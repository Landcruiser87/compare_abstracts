    "title": "Gap-Free Clustering: Sensitivity and Robustness of SDP",
    "description": "We study graph clustering in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) in the presence of both large clusters and small, unrecoverable clusters. Previous convex relaxation approaches achieving exact recovery do not allow any small clusters of size $o(\\sqrt{n})$, or require a size gap between the smallest recovered cluster and the largest non-recovered cluster. We provide an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) which removes these requirements and provably recovers large clusters regardless of the remaining cluster sizes. Mid-sized clusters pose unique challenges to the analysis, since their proximity to the recovery threshold makes them highly sensitive to small noise perturbations and precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques, including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can drastically change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue perturbation bounds of potential independent interest. Our results are robust to certain semirandom settings that are challenging for alternative algorithms. Using our gap-free clustering procedure, we obtain efficient algorithms for the problem of clustering with a faulty oracle with superior query complexities, notably achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity even in the presence of a large number of small clusters. Our gap-free clustering procedure also leads to improved algorithms for recursive clustering.",

    "title": "Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing (Extended Abstract)",
    "description": "We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.

    "description": "Multi-distribution learning (MDL), which seeks to learn a shared model that minimizes the worst-case risk across $k$ distinct data distributions, has emerged as a unified framework in response to the evolving demand for robustness, fairness, multi-group collaboration, etc.  Achieving data-efficient MDL necessitates adaptive sampling, also called on-demand sampling, throughout the learning process. However, there exist substantial gaps between the state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity. Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension $d$,  we propose a novel algorithm that yields an $\\varepsilon$-optimal randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of $\\frac{d+k}{\\varepsilon^2}$ (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic ideas and theory have been further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely through an empirical risk minimization oracle. Additionally, we establish the necessity of randomization, unveiling a large sample size barrier when only deterministic hypotheses are permitted. These findings successfully resolve three open problems presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., Problems 1, 3 and 4 of Awasthi et al. 2023).    ",

    "title": "Settling the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning",
    "description": "A central issue lying at the heart of online reinforcement learning (RL) is data efficiency.  While a number of recent works achieved asymptotically minimal regret in online RL, the optimality of these results is only guaranteed in a \u201clarge-sample\u201d regime, imposing enormous burn-in cost in order for their algorithms to operate optimally. How to achieve minimax-optimal regret without incurring any burn-in cost has been an open problem in RL theory.   We settle this problem for finite-horizon inhomogeneous Markov decision processes. Specifically, we prove that a modified version of MVP (Monotonic Value Propagation), an optimistic model-based algorithm proposed by Zhang et al., achieves a regret on the order of $$\\min\\big\\{  \\sqrt{SAH^3K}, \\,HK \\big\\},$$ where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the horizon length, and $K$ is the total number of episodes. This regret matches the minimax lower bound for the entire range of sample size K, essentially eliminating any burn-in requirement. It also translates to a PAC sample complexity (i.e., the number of episodes needed to yield $\\varepsilon$-accuracy) of $\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}$ up to log factor, which is minimax-optimal for the full epsilon-range. Further, we extend our theory to unveil the influences of problem-dependent quantities like the optimal value/cost and certain variances. The key technical innovation lies in a novel analysis paradigm to decouple complicated statistical dependency \u2014 a long-standing challenge facing the analysis of online RL in the sample-hungry regime.

    "description": "Two-time-scale optimization is a framework introduced in Zeng et al. (2024) that abstracts a range of policy evaluation and policy optimization problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Akin to bi-level optimization under a particular type of stochastic oracle, the two-time-scale optimization framework has an upper level objective whose gradient evaluation depends on the solution of a lower level problem, which is to find the root of a strongly monotone operator. In this work, we propose a new method for solving two-time-scale optimization that achieves significantly faster convergence than the prior arts. The key idea of our approach is to leverage an averaging step to improve the estimates of the operators in both lower and upper levels before using them to update the decision variables. These additional averaging steps eliminate the direct coupling between the main variables, enabling the accelerated performance of our algorithm. We characterize the finite-time convergence rates of the proposed algorithm under various conditions of the underlying objective function, including strong convexity, convexity, Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, and general non-convexity. These rates significantly improve over the best-known complexity of the standard two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm. When applied to RL, we show how the proposed algorithm specializes to novel online sample-based methods that surpass or match the performance of the existing state of the art. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical simulations in RL.",

We consider the scenario where a comparison graph is randomly generated and the adversary is allowed to add arbitrary edges.  The statistician\u2019s goal is then to accurately identify the top-$K$ preferred items based on pairwise comparisons derived from this semi-random comparison graph.  The main contribution of this paper is  to develop a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that achieves near-optimal sample complexity, up to a $\\log^2(n)$ factor, where $n$ denotes the number of items under comparison. This is made possible through a combination of analytical and algorithmic innovations.

    "description": "Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with adversarial examples often results in poor generalization to test-time adversarial data. This paper investigates this issue, known as adversarially robust generalization, through the lens of Rademacher complexity. Building upon the studies by Khim and Loh (2018); Yin et al. (2019), numerous works have been dedicated to this problem, yet achieving a satisfactory bound remains an elusive goal. Existing works on DNNs either apply to a surrogate loss instead of the robust loss or yield bounds that are notably looser compared to their standard counterparts. In the latter case, the bounds have a higher dependency on the width $m$ of the DNNs or the dimension $d$ of the data, with an extra factor of at least $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{m})$ or $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d})$. This paper presents upper bounds for adversarial Rademacher complexity of DNNs that match the best-known upper bounds in standard settings, as established in the work  of Bartlett et al. (2017), with the dependency on width and dimension being $\\mathcal{O}(\\ln(dm))$. The central challenge addressed is calculating the covering number of adversarial function classes. We aim to construct a new cover that possesses two properties: 1) compatibility with adversarial examples, and 2) precision comparable to covers used in standard settings. To this end, we introduce a new variant of covering number called the \\emph{uniform covering number}, specifically designed and proven to reconcile these two properties. Consequently, our method effectively bridges the gap between Rademacher complexity in robust and standard generalization.",

In contrast to traditional active learning that queries a single example for its label, we study more general \\emph{region queries} that allow the learner to pick a subset of the domain $T \\subset \\mathcal X$ and a target label $y$ and ask a labeler whether $h^\\ast(x) = y $ for every example in the set $T \\cap S$. Such more powerful queries allow us to bypass the limitations of traditional active learning and use significantly fewer rounds of interactions to learn but can potentially lead to a significantly more complex query language.

This approach is particularly interesting as it naturally extends the linear structure, and helps explain the behavior of neural-network-based models at their infinite width limit. The analytical results however do not adequately address the performance guarantees for this case. We will highlight this open problem, overview existing partial results, and discuss related challenges.",

    "description": "We show strong (and surprisingly simple) lower bounds for weakly learning intersections of halfspaces in the improper setting. Strikingly little is known about this problem. For instance, it is not even known if there is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning the intersection of only two halfspaces. On the other hand, lower bounds based on well-established assumptions (such as approximating worst-case lattice problems or variants of Feige\u2019s 3SAT hypothesis) are only known (or are implied by existing results) for the intersection of super-logarithmically many halfspaces\u00a0(KS06, KS09, DS16). With intersections of fewer halfspaces being only ruled out under less standard assumptions\u00a0(DV21) (such as the existence of local pseudo-random generators with large stretch). We significantly narrow this gap by showing that even learning $\\omega(\\log \\log N)$ halfspaces in dimension $N$ takes super-polynomial time under standard assumptions on worst-case lattice problems (namely that SVP and SIVP are hard to approximate within polynomial factors). Further, we give unconditional hardness results in the statistical query framework. Specifically, we show that for any $k$ (even constant), learning $k$ halfspaces in dimension $N$ requires accuracy $N^{-\\Omega(k)}$, or exponentially many queries \u2013 in particular ruling out SQ algorithms with polynomial accuracy for $\\omega(1)$ halfspaces. To the best of our knowledge this is the first unconditional hardness result for learning a super-constant number of halfspaces. Our lower bounds are obtained in a unified way via a novel connection we make between intersections of halfspaces and the so-called parallel pancakes distribution\u00a0(DKS17, PLBR19, BRST21) that has been at the heart of many lower bound constructions in (robust)  high-dimensional statistics in the past few years.",

    "description": "Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is a general framework for online decision making under uncertainty.  While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have been established,  existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational costs for high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a simple and practical BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex functions that satisfy a condition we call $\\kappa$-convexity. This class contains a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear losses, quadratic losses, and generalized linear models. In addition to optimal regret,  this method is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including bandit logistic regression. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory. We show that for loss functions with a certain affine structure, the extended algorithm attains optimal regret. This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret for bandit LQ problem under a fully adversarial noise model, thereby resolving an open question posed in Grade et. al. 2020 and Sun et. al. 2023. Finally, we show that the more general problem of BCO with (non-affine) memory is harder.

Such matrices are of particular interest in the study of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor. In the case where the sampling probability is $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \\textit{non-backtracking wedge operator}. When $d$ is above a Kesten-Stigum-type sampling threshold, our algorithm recovers a correlated version of the singular value decomposition of $M$ with quantifiable error bounds. This is the first result in the regime of bounded $d$ for weak recovery and the first for weak consistency when $d\\to\\infty$ arbitrarily slowly without any polylog factors. As an application, for low-CP-rank orthogonal $k$-tensor completion,  we efficiently achieve weak recovery with sample size $O(n^{k/2})$ and weak consistency with sample size $\\omega(n^{k/2})$.

Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling.",

The vector can be interpreted as the incident vector corresponding to $n$ items out of which $k$ items are \\emph{defective}. The \\emph{quantitative group testing} (QGT) problem aims at learning this binary feature vector by queries on subsets of the items that return the total number of defective items. We consider this problem under the \\emph{non-adaptive} scenario where the queries on subsets are designed collectively and can be executed in parallel. Most of the existing efficient non-adaptive algorithms for the sublinear regime where $k = n^\\alpha$ with $0 < \\alpha < 1$ fall short of the information-theoretic lower bound, with a multiplicative gap of $\\log k$. Recently, a near-optimal non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^3)$ closed this gap. In this work, we present a concatenated construction method yielding a non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^{2\\alpha} + n \\log^2 n)$. The probability of decoding failure is analyzed by establishing a connection between the QGT problem and the so-called \\emph{balls into bins} problem. Our algorithm reduces the gap between the information-theoretic and computational bound for the number of required queries/tests from $\\log k$ to $\\log \\log k$. This narrows the gap in the number of tests for non-adaptive algorithms within the class of algorithms with $o(n^2)$ decoding complexity. Moreover, although our algorithm exhibits a $\\log \\log k$ gap in terms of the number of tests, it is surpassed by the existing asymptotically optimal construction only in scenarios where $k$ is exceptionally large for moderate values of $\\alpha$, such as $k > 10^{27}$ for $\\alpha = 0.7$, thereby highlighting the practical applicability of our proposed concatenated construction.",

We establish the global   convergence  of gradient flow under suitable choices of initialization. In addition,  we prove that  an interesting \u201ctask allocation\" phenomenon emerges during the gradient flow dynamics, where each attention head focuses on solving a single task of the multi-task model. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow dynamics can be split into three phases \u2014 a warm-up phase where the loss decreases rather slowly and the attention heads gradually build up their inclination towards individual tasks, an emergence phase where each head selects a single task and the loss rapidly decreases, and a convergence phase  where the attention parameters converge to a limit.  Furthermore, we prove the optimality of gradient flow in the sense that the limiting model learned by gradient flow is on par with the best possible multi-head softmax attention model up to a constant factor.  Our analysis also delineates a strict separation in terms of the prediction accuracy of ICL between single-head and multi-head attention models.  The key technique for our convergence  analysis is to map  the gradient flow dynamics in the parameter space to a set of ordinary differential equations in the spectral domain, where the relative magnitudes of the semi-singular values of the attention weights determines task allocation.   To our best knowledge, our work provides the first convergence result for the multi-head softmax attention model. ",

In the general case, it was recently shown by Arunachalam and de Wolf [JMLR, 19 (2018) 1-36] that quantum PAC learners can only achieve constant factor advantages over classical PAC learners.

For online multiclass classification, Van der Hoeven (2020) established \\emph{finite} surrogate regret bounds, which are independent of the time horizon, by introducing an elegant \\emph{exploit-the-surrogate-gap} framework. However, this framework has been limited to multiclass classification primarily because it relies on a classification-specific procedure for converting estimated scores to outputs. We extend the exploit-the-surrogate-gap framework to online structured prediction with \\emph{Fenchel\u2013Young losses}, a large family of surrogate losses that includes the logistic loss for multiclass classification as a special case, obtaining finite surrogate regret bounds in various structured prediction problems. To this end, we propose and analyze \\emph{randomized decoding}, which converts estimated scores to general structured outputs. Moreover, by applying our decoding to online multiclass classification with the logistic loss, we obtain a surrogate regret bound of $O(\\| \\bm{U} \\|_\\mathrm{F}^2)$, where $\\bm{U}$ is the best offline linear estimator and $\\| \\cdot \\|_\\mathrm{F}$ denotes the Frobenius norm.

    "description": "Score matching is an approach to learning probability distributions parametrized up to a constant of proportionality (e.g., energy-based models). The idea is to fit the score of the distribution rather than the likelihood, thus avoiding the need to evaluate the constant of proportionality. While there\u2019s a clear algorithmic benefit, the statistical cost can be steep: recent work by Koehler et al. (2022) showed that for distributions that have poor isoperimetric properties (a large Poincar{\u00e9} or log-Sobolev constant), score matching is substantially statistically less efficient than maximum likelihood. However, many natural realistic distributions, e.g. multimodal distributions as simple as a mixture of two Gaussians in one dimension have a poor Poincar{\u00e9} constant. In this paper, we show a close connection between the mixing time of a broad class of Markov processes with generator L and stationary distribution p, and an appropriately chosen generalized score matching loss that tries to fit Op. In the special case of O being a gradient operator, and L being the generator of Langevin diffusion, this generalizes and recovers the results from Koehler et al. (2022). This allows us to adapt techniques to speed up Markov chains to construct better score-matching losses. In particular, \"preconditioning\" the diffusion can be translated to an appropriate \"preconditioning\" of the score loss. Lifting the chain by adding a temperature like in simulated tempering can be shown to result in a Gaussian-convolution annealed score matching loss, similar to Song and Ermon (2019). Moreover, we show that if the distribution being learned is a finite mixture of Gaussians in d dimensions with a shared covariance, the sample complexity of annealed score matching is polynomial in the ambient dimension, the diameter of the means, and the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the covariance. To show this we bound the mixing time of a \"continuously tempered\" version of Langevin diffusion for mixtures, which is of standalone interest.",

This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by B\u0142{}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants. We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then show that an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class. On the lower bound side, an $\\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.",

    "description": "Fingerprinting arguments, first introduced by Bun, Ullman, and Vadhan (STOC 2014), are the most widely used method for establishing lower bounds on the sample complexity or error of approximately differentially private (DP) algorithms. Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which we don\u2019t know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lower bounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger than some threshold. In this work, we present a new framework and tools to generate smooth lower bounds on the sample complexity of differentially private algorithms satisfying very weak accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of our method by providing new lower bounds in various settings: 1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which in particular implies a lower bound for the private 1-cluster problem introduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016). 2. A lower bound on the additive error of DP algorithms for approximate k-means clustering and general (k,z)-clustering, as a function of the multiplicative error, which is tight for a constant multiplication error. 3. A lower bound for estimating the top singular vector of a matrix under DP in low-accuracy regimes, which is a special case of DP subspace estimation studied by Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021). Our main technique is to apply a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. However, rather than proving our results using a black-box access to an existing fingerprinting code (e.g., Tardos\u2019 code), we develop a new fingerprinting lemma that is stronger than those of Dwork et al. (FOCS 2015) and Bun et al. (SODA 2017), and prove our lower bounds directly from the lemma.

The main technical result concerns an $f$-divergence inequality between members of the Jensen\u2013Shannon and Hellinger families, which is proved by a combination of information-theoretic tools and case-by-case analyses.

    "description": "The dynamical stability of optimization methods at the vicinity of minima of the loss has recently attracted significant attention. For gradient descent (GD), stable convergence is possible only to minima that are sufficiently flat w.r.t. the step size, and those have been linked with favorable properties of the trained model. However, while the stability threshold of GD is well-known, to date, no explicit expression has been derived for the exact threshold of stochastic GD (SGD). In this paper, we derive such a closed-form expression. Specifically, we provide an explicit condition on the step size that is both necessary and sufficient for the linear stability of SGD in the mean square sense. Our analysis sheds light on the precise role of the batch size B. In particular, we show that the stability threshold is monotonically non-decreasing in the batch size, which means that reducing the batch size can only decrease stability. Furthermore, we show that SGD\u2019s stability threshold is equivalent to that of a mixture process which takes in each iteration a full batch gradient step w.p. 1-p, and a single sample gradient step w.p. $p$, where $p \\approx 1/B$. This indicates that even with moderate batch sizes, SGD\u2019s stability threshold is very close to that of GD\u2019s. We also prove simple necessary conditions for linear stability, which depend on the batch size, and are easier to compute than the precise threshold. Finally, we derive the asymptotic covariance of the dynamics around the minimum, and discuss its dependence on the learning rate. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on the MNIST dataset.",

Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the task of recovering the \\emph{entire} graph, which requires $\\Omega ( \\log n)$ cascades for an $n$-vertex bounded degree graph. Here we ask a different question: can the important parts of the graph be estimated from just a few (i.e., constant number) of cascades, even as $n$ grows large? In this work, we focus on identifying super-spreaders (i.e., high-degree vertices) from infection times caused by a Susceptible-Infected process on a graph. Our first main result shows that vertices of degree greater than $n^{3/4}$ can indeed be estimated from a constant number of cascades. Our algorithm for doing so leverages a novel connection between vertex degrees and the second derivative of the cumulative infection curve. Conversely, we show that estimating vertices of degree smaller than $n^{1/2}$ requires at least $\\log(n) / \\log \\log (n)$ cascades.

Such estimators have also been shown to exhibit strong connections to distributionally robust optimization. Despite the progress in the design of pivotal estimators, the resulting minimization problem is challenging as both the loss function and the regularization term are non-smooth. To date, the design of fast, robust, and scalable algorithms with strong convergence rate guarantees is still an open problem. This work addresses this problem by showing that an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm exhibits global linear convergence under the weakest assumption available in the literature.

Each autobidder is tasked with maximizing its advertiser\u2019s total value over multiple rounds of a repeated auction, subject to budget and return-on-investment constraints. We propose a gradient-based learning algorithm that is guaranteed to satisfy all constraints and achieves vanishing individual regret. Our algorithm uses only bandit feedback and can be used with the first- or second-price auction, as well as with any \u201cintermediate\u201d auction format. Our main result is that when these autobidders play against each other, the resulting expected liquid welfare over all rounds is at least half of the expected optimal liquid welfare achieved by any allocation. Our analysis holds whether or not the bidding dynamics converges to an equilibrium, side-stepping the dearth of provable convergence guarantees in the literature and the hardness result (Chen et al., 2021) which precludes such guarantees for budget-constrained second-price auctions. Our vanishing-regret result extends to an adversarial environment, without any assumptions on the other agents. We adopt a non-standard benchmark: the sequence of bids such that each bid $b_t$ maximizes value for the environment in round $t$. Hence, we side-step the impossibility results for the standard benchmark of best fixed bid (Balseiro and Gur, 2019). When there is only a budget constraint, our algorithm specializes to the autobidding algorithm from (Balseiro and Gur, 2019), and our guarantees specialize to the regret and liquid welfare guarantees from Gaitonde et al.

In this paper, we study the spatial adaptation property of Bayesian tree-based methods in the unsupervised setting, with a focus on the density estimation problem. We characterize spatial heterogeneity of the underlying density function by using anisotropic Besov spaces, region-wise anisotropic Besov spaces, and two novel function classes as their extensions. For two types of commonly used prior distributions on trees under the context of unsupervised learning\u2014the optional P{\u00f3}lya tree (Wong and Ma, 2010) and the Dirichlet prior (Lu et al., 2013)\u2014we calculate posterior concentration rates when the density function exhibits different types of heterogeneity. In specific, we show that the posterior concentration rate for trees is near minimax over the anisotropic Besov space. The rate is adaptive in the sense that to achieve such a rate we do not need any prior knowledge of the parameters of the Besov space.",

    "description": "Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\\rho\\in\\mathbb{C}^{d\\times d}$, quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\\rho=\\rho_0$ or $\\|\\rho-\\rho_0\\|_1>\\varepsilon$, where $\\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements, namely measurements which operate only on one copy of $\\rho$ at a time. When there is a common source of randomness available and the unentangled measurements are chosen based on this randomness, prior work has shown that $\\Theta(d^{3/2}/\\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds even when the measurements are allowed to be chosen adaptively. We consider deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed to randomized) and demonstrate that ${\\Theta}(d^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms with and without randomness.  We develop a lower bound framework for both fixed and randomized measurements that relates the hardness of testing to the well-established L\u00fcders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds for randomized and fixed schemes as a function of the eigenvalues of the L\u00fcders channel which characterizes one possible post-measurement state transformation.",

Despite the widespread use of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework with various choices of regularization, the FTPL framework, which relies on random perturbations, has not received much attention, despite its inherent simplicity. In adversarial bandits, there has been conjecture that FTPL could potentially achieve $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{KT})$ regrets if perturbations follow a distribution with a Fr\u00e9chet-type tail. Recent work by Honda et al. (2023) showed that FTPL with Fr\u00e9chet distribution with shape $\\alpha=2$ indeed attains this bound and, notably logarithmic regret in stochastic bandits, meaning the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) capability of FTPL. However, this result only partly resolves the above conjecture because their analysis heavily relies on the specific form of the Fr\u00e9chet distribution with this shape. In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition for perturbations to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{KT})$ regrets in the adversarial setting, which covers, e.g., Fr\u00e9chet, Pareto, and Student-$t$ distributions. We also demonstrate the BOBW achievability of FTPL with certain Fr\u00e9chet-type tail distributions.  Our results contribute not only to resolving existing conjectures through the lens of extreme value theory but also potentially offer insights into the effect of the regularization functions in FTRL through the mapping from FTPL to FTRL.",

While for many learning tasks (such as binary classification and online learning) there is a notion of dimension whose finiteness is equivalent to learnability within any level of accuracy, we show, rather surprisingly, that such parameter does not exist for distribution learning. Concretely, our results apply for several general notions of characterizing learnability and for several learning tasks. We show that there is no notion of dimension that characterizes the sample complexity of learning distribution classes. We then consider the weaker requirement of only characterizing learnability (rather than the quantitative sample complexity function). We propose some natural requirements for such a characterization and go on to show that there exists no characterization of learnability that satisfies these requirements for classes of distributions. Furthermore, we show that our results hold for various other learning problems. In particular, we show that there is no notion of dimension characterizing PAC-learnability for any of the tasks: classification learning w.r.t. a restricted set of marginal distributions and learnability of classes of real-valued functions with continuous losses.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of proving concentration inequalities to estimate the mean of the sequence. An example of such a problem is the estimation of the generalization error of some predictor trained by a stochastic algorithm, such as a neural network, where $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is approached through a \\emph{PAC-Bayes} analysis where, in addition to the posterior, we choose a \\emph{prior} distribution which captures our belief about the inductive bias of the learning problem. Then, the key quantity in PAC-Bayes concentration bounds is a divergence that captures the \\emph{complexity} of the learning problem where the de facto standard choice is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, the tightness of this choice has rarely been  questioned.   In this paper, we challenge the tightness of the KL-divergence-based bounds by showing that it is possible to achieve a strictly tighter bound. In particular, we demonstrate new \\emph{high-probability} PAC-Bayes bounds with a novel and \\emph{better-than-KL} divergence that is inspired by Zhang et al. (2022). Our proof is inspired by recent advances in regret analysis of gambling algorithms, and its use to derive concentration inequalities. Our result is first-of-its-kind in that existing PAC-Bayes bounds with non-KL divergences are not known to be strictly better than KL. Thus, we believe our work marks the first step towards identifying optimal rates of PAC-Bayes bounds.",

For instance, the Langevin algorithm can be viewed as a sampling analogue of gradient descent and has condition-number-dependent guarantees on its performance. In the early 1990s, Nesterov and Nemirovski developed the Interior-Point Method (IPM) for convex optimization based on self-concordant barriers, providing efficient algorithms for structured convex optimization, often faster than the general method. This raises the following question: can we develop an analogous IPM for structured sampling problems? In 2012, Kannan and Narayanan proposed the Dikin walk for uniformly sampling polytopes, and an improved analysis was given in 2020 by Laddha-Lee-Vempala. The Dikin walk uses a local metric defined by a self-concordant barrier for linear constraints. Here we generalize this approach by developing and adapting IPM machinery together with the Dikin walk for poly-time sampling algorithms. Our IPM-based sampling framework provides an efficient warm start and goes beyond uniform distributions and linear constraints. We illustrate the approach on important special cases, in particular giving the fastest algorithms to sample uniform, exponential, or Gaussian distributions on a truncated PSD cone. The framework is general and can be applied to other sampling algorithms.",

Exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate for both the continuous dynamics and the discrete sampler are then proved under $W_2$ distance. Only compactness of the Lie group and geodesically $L$-smoothness of the potential function are needed.

We answer this affirmatively and show that the task indeed remains NP-hard even if T is allowed to be within any constant factor of optimal. More generally, our result allows for a smooth tradeoff between the hardness assumption and inapproximability factor.

The standard approach in this setting is to bound the loss of a classifier in terms of some notion of distance between D and D\u2019.  These distances, however, seem difficult to compute and do not lead to efficient algorithms. We depart from this paradigm and define a new model called  testable learning with distribution shift, where we can obtain provably efficient algorithms for certifying the performance of a classifier on a test distribution.  In this model, a learner outputs a classifier with low test error whenever samples from D and D\u2019 pass an associated test; moreover, the test must accept (with high probability) if the marginal of D equals the marginal of D\u2019. We give several positive results for learning well-studied concept classes such as halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, and decision trees when the marginal of D is Gaussian or uniform on the hypercube.  Prior to our work, no efficient algorithms for these basic cases were known without strong assumptions on D\u2019. For halfspaces in the realizable case (where there exists a halfspace consistent with both D and D\u2019), we combine a moment-matching approach with ideas from active learning to simulate an efficient oracle for estimating disagreement regions. To extend to the non-realizable setting, we apply recent work from testable (agnostic) learning.  More generally, we prove that any function class with low-degree $\\mathcal{L}_2$-sandwiching polynomial approximators can be learned in our model.  Since we require $\\mathcal{L}_2$- sandwiching (instead of the usual $\\mathcal{L}_1$ loss), we cannot directly appeal to convex duality and instead apply constructions from the pseudorandomness literature to obtain the required approximators.  We also provide lower bounds to show that the guarantees we obtain on the performance of our output hypotheses are best possible up to constant factors, as well as a separation showing that realizable learning in our model is incomparable to (ordinary) agnostic learning.",

In particular, the prediction error of Lasso becomes much worse than computationally inefficient alternatives like Best Subset Selection. Due to a large conjectured computational-statistical tradeoff in the problem of sparse linear regression, it may be impossible to close this gap in general. In this work, we propose a natural sparse linear regression setting where strong correlations between covariates arise from unobserved latent variables. In this setting, we analyze the problem caused by strong correlations and design a surprisingly simple fix. While Lasso with standard normalization of covariates fails, there exists a heterogeneous scaling of the covariates with which Lasso will suddenly obtain strong provable guarantees for estimation. Moreover, we design a simple, efficient procedure for computing such a \u201csmart scaling.\u201d The sample complexity of the resulting \u201crescaled Lasso\u201d algorithm incurs (in the worst case) quadratic dependence on the sparsity of the underlying signal. While this dependence is not information-theoretically necessary, we give evidence that it is optimal among the class of polynomial-time algorithms, via the method of low-degree polynomials. This argument reveals a new connection between sparse linear regression and a special version of sparse PCA with a \\emph{near-critical negative spike}. The latter problem can be thought of as a real-valued analogue of learning a sparse parity.

What the optimal rate is depends on the distribution and it is generally attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, MLE requires exact knowledge of the underlying distribution; if the underlying distribution is \\emph{unknown}, it is an open question whether an estimator can adapt to the optimal rate. In this paper, we propose an estimator of the symmetric mean $\\theta_0$ with the following properties: it requires no knowledge of the underlying distribution; it has a rate no worse than $1/\\sqrt{n}$ in all cases (assuming a finite second moment) and, when the underlying distribution is compactly supported, our estimator can attain a rate of $n^{-\\frac{1}{{\\alpha}}}$ up to polylog factors, where the rate parameter $\\alpha$ can take on any value in $(0, 2]$ and depends on the moments of the underlying distribution. Our estimator is formed by minimizing the $L_\\gamma$-loss with respect to the data, for a power $\\gamma \\geq 2$ chosen in a data-driven way \u2013 by minimizing a criterion motivated by the asymptotic variance. Our approach can be directly applied to the regression setting where $\\theta_0$ is a function of observed features and motivates the use of $L_\\gamma$ loss function with a data-driven $\\gamma$ in certain settings.

    "title": "Smaller Confidence Intervals From IPW Estimators via Data-Dependent Coarsening (Extended Abstract)",
    "description": "Inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimators are prevalent in causal inference for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies. Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\\epsilon>0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1). We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants. Each CIPW estimator is an IPW estimator on a coarsened covariate space, where certain covariates are merged. Under mild assumptions, e.g., Lipschitzness in expected outcomes and sparsity of extreme propensity scores, we give an efficient algorithm to find a robust estimator: given $\\epsilon$-inaccurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, its confidence interval size scales with $\\epsilon+(1/\\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, under the same assumptions, existing estimators\u2019 confidence interval sizes are $\\Omega(1)$ irrespective of $\\epsilon$ and $n$. Crucially, our estimator is data-dependent and we show that no data-independent CIPW estimator can be robust to inaccuracies. ",

    "description": "Differentially private computation often begins with a bound on some $d$-dimensional statistic\u2019s $\\ell_p$ sensitivity. For pure differential privacy, the $K$-norm mechanism can improve on this approach using a norm tailored to the statistic\u2019s sensitivity space. Writing down a closed-form description of this optimal norm is often straightforward. However, running the $K$-norm mechanism reduces to uniformly sampling the norm\u2019s unit ball; this ball is a $d$-dimensional convex body, so general sampling algorithms can be slow. Turning to concentrated differential privacy, elliptic Gaussian noise offers similar improvement over spherical Gaussian noise. Once the shape of this ellipse is determined, sampling is easy; however, identifying the best such shape may be hard. This paper solves both problems for the simple statistics of sum, count, and vote. For each statistic, we provide a sampler for the optimal $K$-norm mechanism that runs in time $\\tilde O(d^2)$ and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal shape of elliptic Gaussian noise. The resulting algorithms all yield meaningful accuracy improvements while remaining fast and simple enough to be practical. More broadly, we suggest that problem-specific sensitivity space analysis may be an overlooked tool for private additive noise.",

We show that this bound is optimal in both its sparsity and query complexity, and we separate our results from the related notion of additive spectral sparsification.

Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question of whether bounded  (all-policy) concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is \\emph{admissible} (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest. ",

When combined with previous state-of-the-art methods our result closes a gap between the best-known query depth and the best-known computational depth of parallel algorithms.  Our method starts with a \\emph{ball acceleration} framework of previous parallel methods, i.e., [CJJJLST20, ACJJS21], which reduce the problem to minimizing a regularized Gaussian convolution of the function constrained to Euclidean balls. By developing and leveraging new stability properties of the Hessian of this induced function, we depart from prior parallel algorithms and reduce these ball-constrained optimization problems to stochastic unconstrained quadratic minimization problems. Although we are unable to prove concentration of the asymmetric matrices that we use to approximate this Hessian, we nevertheless develop an efficient parallel method for solving these quadratics.

In statistical settings, the goal of $k$-PCA is to identify a top eigenspace of the covariance matrix of a distribution, which we only have black-box access to via samples. Motivated by these  settings, we analyze black-box deflation methods as a framework for designing $k$-PCA algorithms, where we model access to the unknown target matrix via a black-box $1$-PCA oracle which returns an approximate top eigenvector, under two popular notions of approximation. Despite being arguably the most natural reduction-based approach to $k$-PCA algorithm design, such black-box methods, which recursively call a $1$-PCA oracle $k$ times, were previously poorly-understood.  Our main contribution is significantly sharper bounds on the approximation parameter degradation of deflation methods for $k$-PCA. For a quadratic form notion of approximation we term ePCA (energy PCA), we show deflation methods suffer no parameter loss. For an alternative well-studied approximation notion we term cPCA (correlation PCA), we tightly characterize the parameter regimes where deflation methods are feasible. Moreover, we show that in all feasible regimes, $k$-cPCA deflation algorithms suffer no asymptotic parameter loss for any constant $k$. We apply our framework to obtain state-of-the-art $k$-PCA algorithms robust to dataset contamination, improving prior work in sample complexity by a $\\mathsf{poly}(k)$ factor.",

To this end, we formulate the problem of adjusting FTRL\u2019s learning rate as a sequential decision-making problem and introduce the framework of competitive analysis. We establish a lower bound for the competitive ratio and propose update rules for the learning rate that achieves an upper bound within a constant factor of this lower bound. Specifically, we illustrate that the optimal competitive ratio is characterized by the (approximate) monotonicity of components of the penalty term, showing that a constant competitive ratio is achievable if the components of the penalty term form a monotone non-increasing sequence, and derive a tight competitive ratio when penalty terms are $\\xi$-approximately monotone non-increasing. Our proposed update rule, referred to as \\textit{stability-penalty matching}, also facilitates the construction of Best-Of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithms for stochastic and adversarial environments. In these environments our results contribute to achieving tighter regret bound and broaden the applicability of algorithms for various settings such as multi-armed bandits, graph bandits, linear bandits, and contextual bandits.",

    "description": " To sample from a general target distribution $p_*\\propto e^{-f_*}$ beyond the isoperimetric condition, Huang et al. (2023) proposed to perform sampling through reverse diffusion, giving rise to Diffusion-based  Monte Carlo (DMC). Specifically,  DMC follows the reverse SDE of a diffusion process that transforms the target distribution to the standard Gaussian, utilizing a non-parametric score estimation. However, the original DMC algorithm encountered high gradient complexity, resulting in an exponential dependency on the error tolerance $\\epsilon$ of the obtained samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that the high complexity of the original DMC algorithm originates from its redundant design of score estimation, and proposed a more efficient DMC algorithm, called RS-DMC, based on a novel recursive score estimation method. In particular, we first divide the entire diffusion process into multiple segments and then formulate the score estimation step (at any time step) as a series of interconnected mean estimation and sampling subproblems accordingly, which are correlated in a recursive manner. Importantly, we show that with a proper design of the segment decomposition, all sampling subproblems will only need to tackle a strongly log-concave distribution, which can be very efficient to solve using the standard sampler (e.g., Langevin Monte Carlo) with a provably rapid convergence rate. As a result, we prove that the gradient complexity of RS-DMC exhibits merely a quasi-polynomial dependency on $\\epsilon$. This finding is highly unexpected as it substantially enhances the prevailing belief of the necessity for exponential gradient complexity in all prior works such as Huang et al. (2023). Under commonly used dissipative conditions, our algorithm is provably much faster than the popular Langevin-based algorithms. Our algorithm design and theoretical framework illuminate a novel direction for addressing sampling problems, which could be of broader applicability in the community. ",

Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves \\emph{is} possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\\log d)$ and $\\rho \\leq c \\varepsilon$ for some universal $c > 0$.

We focus on uniform convergence (which is the basis of Empirical Risk Minimization) and on sample compression (which is a powerful manifestation of Occam\u2019s Razor). In classical PAC learning, both uniform convergence and sample compression satisfy a form of \u2018completeness\u2019: whenever a class is learnable, it can also be learned by a learning rule that adheres to these principles.

In contrast, our findings reveal surprising results regarding sample compression: we prove that when the label space is $Y=\\{0,1,2\\}$, then there are 2-list-learnable classes that cannot be compressed. This refutes the list version of the sample compression conjecture by Littlestone and Warmuth in 1986.

    "description": "This article presents a number of elementary observations and relations concerning commonly-studied combinatorial dimensions from the learning theory literature on classification and reinforcement learning: namely, the star number, eluder dimension, VC dimension, Littlestone dimension, threshold dimension, and cardinality of the class. One theme of the work is understanding how these dimensions may be re-expressed as natural dimensions of the convexity space of version spaces. Specifically, we find that the star number is precisely the VC dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions), whereas the eluder dimension is precisely the threshold dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions). We are also interested in understanding direct relations among these dimensions. For instance, we show that there is no infinite concept class with both finite Littlestone dimension and finite star number. Moreover, any infinite concept class must have infinite eluder dimension. In both cases, we also provide quantitative relations to the cardinality of the class. For the latter result, we also show an analogous relation for real-valued functions, where the cardinality of the class is replaced by the $L_\\infty$ covering number. As another relation between star numbers and VC dimension, we provide a simple, precise, and general characterization of the VC dimension of the minimal intersection-closed class containing a given concept class: namely, the 1-centered star number of the original class. Moreover, we generalize this result to provide a unifying approach to the design of certain sample compression schemes, along with a simple combinatorial dimension characterizing its compression size: the minimum star number. We also discuss a number of implications of many of these observations.

    "description": "Consider the problem of predicting the next symbol given a sample path of length $n$, whose joint distribution belongs to a distribution class that may have long-term memory. The goal is to compete with the conditional predictor that knows the true model. For both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and renewal processes, we determine the optimal prediction risk in Kullback-Leibler divergence up to universal constant factors.  Extending existing results in finite-order Markov models (Han et al. (2023)) and drawing ideas from universal compression, the proposed estimator has a prediction risk bounded by redundancy of the distribution class and a memory term that accounts for the long-range dependency of the model. Notably, for HMMs with bounded state and observation spaces, a polynomial-time estimator based on dynamic programming is shown to achieve the optimal prediction risk $\\Theta(\\frac{\\log n}{n})$; prior to this work, the only known result of this type is $O(\\frac{1}{\\log n})$ obtained using Markov approximation (Sharan et al.

    "description": "We study the weak recovery problem on the $r$-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model ($r$-HSBM) with two balanced communities. In this model, $n$ vertices are randomly divided into two communities, and size-$r$ hyperedges are added randomly depending on whether all vertices in the hyperedge are in the same community. The goal of weak recovery is to recover a non-trivial fraction of the communities given the hypergraph. Pal and Zhu (2021); Stephan and Zhu (2022) established that weak recovery is always possible above a natural threshold called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. For assortative models (i.e., monochromatic hyperedges are preferred), Gu and Polyanskiy (2023) proved that the KS threshold is tight if $r\\le 4$ or the expected degree $d$ is small. For other cases, the tightness of the KS threshold remained open. In this paper we determine the tightness of the KS threshold for a wide range of parameters. We prove that for $r\\le 6$ and $d$ large enough, the KS threshold is tight. This shows that there is no information-computation gap in this regime and partially confirms a conjecture of  Angelini et al. (2015). On the other hand, we show that for $r\\ge 5$, there exist parameters for which the KS threshold is not tight. In particular, for $r\\ge 7$, the KS threshold is not tight if the model is disassortative (i.e., polychromatic hyperedges are preferred) or $d$ is large enough. This provides more evidence supporting the existence of an information-computation gap in these cases. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic bounds on the weak recovery threshold for fixed $r$ and large $d$. We also obtain a number of results regarding the broadcasting on hypertrees (BOHT) model, including the asymptotics of the reconstruction threshold for $r\\ge 7$ and impossibility of robust reconstruction at criticality.",

However, the effects of computability requirements in PAC-type frameworks are only just starting to emerge.  We introduce the problem of robust computable PAC (robust CPAC) learning and provide some simple sufficient conditions for this.  We then show that learnability in this setup is not implied by the combination of its components: classes that are both CPAC and robustly PAC learnable are not necessarily robustly CPAC learnable.  Furthermore, we show that the novel framework exhibits some surprising effects: for robust CPAC learnability it is not required that the robust loss is computably evaluable! Towards understanding characterizing properties, we introduce a novel dimension, the computable robust shattering dimension.  We prove that its finiteness is necessary, but not sufficient for robust CPAC learnability.  This might yield novel insights for the corresponding phenomenon in the context of robust PAC learnability, where insufficiency of the robust shattering dimension for learnability has been conjectured, but so far a resolution has remained elusive.",

    "description": "Consider the supervised learning setting where the goal is to learn to predict labels $\\mathbf y$ given points $\\mathbf x$ from a distribution. An \\textit{omnipredictor} for a class $\\mathcal L$ of loss functions and a class $\\mathcal C$ of hypotheses is a predictor whose predictions incur less expected loss than the best hypothesis in $\\mathcal C$ for every loss in $\\mathcal L$. Since the work of Gopalan et al. (2021) that introduced the notion, there has been a large body of work in the setting of binary labels where $\\mathbf y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, but much less is known about the regression setting where $\\mathbf y \\in [0,1]$ can be continuous. The naive generalization of the previous approaches to regression is to predict the probability distribution of $y$, discretized to $\\varepsilon$-width intervals. The running time would be exponential in the size of the output of the omnipredictor, which is $1/\\varepsilon$. Our main conceptual contribution is the notion of \\textit{sufficient statistics} for loss minimization over a family of loss functions: these are a set of statistics about a distribution such that knowing them allows one to take actions that minimize the expected loss for any loss in the family. The notion of sufficient statistics relates directly to the approximate rank of the family of loss functions. Thus, improved bounds on the latter yield improved runtimes for learning omnipredictors. Our key technical contribution is a bound of $O(1/\\varepsilon^{2/3})$ on the $\\epsilon$-approximate rank of convex, Lipschitz functions on the interval $[0,1]$, which we show is tight up to a factor of $\\mathrm{polylog} (1/\\epsilon)$.  This yields improved runtimes for learning omnipredictors for the class of all convex, Lipschitz loss functions under weak learnability assumptions about the class $\\mathcal C$. We also give efficient omnipredictors when the loss families have low-degree polynomial approximations, or arise from generalized linear models (GLMs). This translation from sufficient statistics to faster omnipredictors is made possible by lifting the technique of loss outcome indistinguishability introduced by Gopalan et al.

In this work, we study the following foundational question: \\emph{Are there notions of multi-class calibration that give strong guarantees of meaningful predictions and can be achieved in time and sample complexities polynomial in $k$?} Prior notions of calibration exhibit a tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressivity: they either suffer from having sample complexity exponential in $k$, or needing to solve computationally intractable problems, or give rather weak guarantees.  Our main contribution is a notion of calibration that achieves all these desiderata: we formulate a robust notion of \\emph{projected smooth calibration} for multi-class predictions, and give new recalibration algorithms for efficiently calibrating predictors under this definition with complexity polynomial in $k$. Projected smooth calibration gives strong guarantees for all downstream decision makers who want to use the predictor for binary classification problems of the form: does the label belong to a subset $T \\subseteq [k]$: \\emph{e.g. is this an image of an animal?} It ensures that the probabilities predicted by summing the probabilities assigned to labels in $T$ are close to some perfectly calibrated binary predictor for that task. We also show that natural strengthenings of our definition are computationally hard to achieve: they run into information theoretic barriers or computational intractability.  Underlying both our upper and lower bounds is a tight connection that we prove between multi-class calibration and the well-studied problem of agnostic learning in the (standard) binary prediction setting. This allows us to use kernel methods to design efficient algorithms, and also to use known hardness results for agnostic learning based on the hardness of refuting random CSPs to show lower bounds.

We study the tradeoffs between efficacy and smooth safety costs of SLBs over polytopes, and the role of aggressive {doubly-optimistic play} in avoiding the strong assumptions made by extant pessimistic-optimistic approaches.  We first elucidate an inherent hardness in SLBs due the lack of knowledge of constraints: there exist \u2018easy\u2019 instances, for which suboptimal extreme points have large \u2018gaps\u2019, but on which SLB methods must still incur $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ regret or safety violations, due to an inability to resolve unknown optima to arbitrary precision.

Further, when safety is demanded to a finite precision, violations improve to $O(\\log^2 T).$ These results rely on a novel dual analysis of linear bandits: we argue that \\textsc{doss} proceeds by activating noisy versions of at least $d$ constraints in each round, which allows us to separately analyse rounds where a \u2018poor\u2019 set of constraints is activated, and rounds where \u2018good\u2019 sets of constraints are activated.

The existence of a computation-information gap in a specific Bayesian high-dimensional asymptotic regime has been conjectured by Lesieur et. al (2016) based on the replica heuristic from statistical physics.  We provide  evidence of the existence of such a gap generically in the high-dimensional regime $p\\geq n$, by (i)  proving a non-asymptotic low-degree polynomials computational barrier for clustering in high-dimension, matching the performance of the best known polynomial time algorithms, and by (ii) establishing that the information barrier for clustering is smaller than the computational barrier, when the number $K$ of clusters is large enough.  These results are in contrast with the (moderately) low-dimensional regime $n\\geq \\text{poly}(p,K)$, where there is no computation-information gap for clustering a mixture of isotropic Gaussian.

    "title": "Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Extended Abstract)",
    "description": " We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin\u2019s minorisation. Moreover, we can define a notion of convergence of Markov processes in Orlicz spaces, which depends on the corresponding contraction coefficient.  The key novelty comes from duality considerations: the convergence of a Markovian process determined by $K$ depends on the contraction coefficient of its dual $K^\\star$, which can in turn be bounded by considering appropriate nested norms of densities of $K^\\star$ with respect to the stationary measure. Our approach stands out as the first of its kind, as it does not rely on the existence of a spectral gap. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin\u2019s interpolation methods. We present the following applications of the proposed framework: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes: one can relate the contraction coefficient of the dual operator to the mixing time of the corresponding Markov chain regardless of the norm chosen. Consequently, our tighter bound on the contraction coefficient implies a tighter bound on the mixing time. We offer a result that provides an intuitive understanding of what it means to be close in a specific norm (relating the probability of any event with the probability of the same event under the stationary measure $\\pi$ and a $\\psi$-Orlicz/Amemiya-norm). We then focus on $L_p$ norms and show that asking for a bounded norm with larger $p$ guarantees a faster decay in the probability. This is particularly relevant for exponentially decaying probabilities under $\\pi$. Moreover, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. \\item Improved concentration bounds for MCMC methods leading to improved lower bounds on the burn-in period: by leveraging $L_p$-norms with large $p$ and our results on the contraction coefficient, similar to the approach undertaken for the mixing times, we can provide improved exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods. \\item Improved concentration bounds for sequences of Markovian random variables: we show how our results can be used to outperform existing bounds based on a change of measure technique for random variables with a Markovian dependence. In particular, we can prove exponential concentration in new settings (inaccessible to earlier approaches) and improve the rate in others. \\end{enumerate}",

Recently, empirical studies showed that neural networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated data set into a topologically simpler one as it passes through the layers. This topological simplification has been measured by Betti numbers, which are algebraic invariants of a topological space. We use the same measure to establish lower and upper bounds on the topological simplification a ReLU neural network can achieve with a given architecture. We therefore contribute to a better understanding of the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the context of binary classification problems by shedding light on their ability to capture the underlying topological structure of the data. In particular the results show that deep ReLU neural networks are exponentially more powerful than shallow ones in terms of topological simplification. This provides a mathematically rigorous explanation why deeper networks are better equipped to handle complex and topologically rich data sets.",

We start by considering the realizable setting with independent Gaussian noise, where for any given noise level and distribution of inputs, we obtain the \\emph{exact} minimax quantile risk for a rich family of error functions and establish the minimaxity of OLS. This improves on the lower bounds obtained by Lecue and Mendelson (2016) and Mendelson (2017) for the special case of square error, and provides us with a lower bound on the minimax quantile risk over larger sets of distributions.  Under the square error and a fourth moment assumption on the distribution of inputs, we show that this lower bound is tight over a larger class of problems. Specifically, we prove a matching upper bound on the worst-case quantile risk of a variant of the procedure proposed by Lecue and Lerasle (2020), thereby establishing its minimaxity, up to absolute constants. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by extending this result to all $p$-th power error functions for $p \\in (2, \\infty)$. Along the way, we develop a generic analogue to the classical Bayesian method for lower bounding the minimax risk when working with the quantile risk, as well as a tight characterization of the quantiles of the smallest eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrix.",

In this paper, we first establish a universal lower bound for the error rate in clustering any mixture model, expressed through Chernoff information, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures featuring Laplace-distributed errors. Additionally, for datasets better modelled by Poisson or Negative Binomial mixtures, we study mixture models whose distributions belong to an exponential family. In such mixtures, we establish that Bregman hard clustering, a variant of Lloyd\u2019s algorithm employing a Bregman divergence, is rate optimal.",

In this paper, we investigate  the question of whether the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there a weaker oracle than ERM  which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which only returns a \\emph{single bit} indicating whether a given dataset is realizable by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle.

For instance, given a classifier determining loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close their credit cards and bank accounts to fool the classifier. The learning goal is to find a classifier robust against strategic manipulations. Various settings, based on what and when information is known, have been explored in strategic classification. In this work, we focus on addressing a fundamental question: the learnability gaps between strategic classification and standard learning.  We essentially show that any learnable class is also strategically learnable: we first consider a fully informative setting, where the manipulation structure (which is modeled by a manipulation graph $G^\\star$) is known and during training time the learner has access to both the pre-manipulation data and post-manipulation data. We provide nearly tight sample complexity and regret bounds, offering significant improvements over prior results. Then, we relax the fully informative setting by introducing two natural types of uncertainty.  First, following Ahmadi et al. (2023), we consider the setting in which the learner only has access to the post-manipulation data. We improve the results of Ahmadi et al. (2023) and close the gap between mistake upper bound and lower bound raised by them.  Our second relaxation of the fully informative setting introduces uncertainty to the manipulation structure. That is, we assume that the manipulation graph is unknown but belongs to a known class of graphs. We provide nearly tight bounds on the learning complexity in various unknown manipulation graph settings.

More specifically, in every time step $t\\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that $\\Delta_t\\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate $n_t\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^t \\Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that {\\em all of the outputs together}, across all time steps, satisfy {\\em event level} differential privacy.  The main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al. (2015) showed an upper bound of $O\\left(\\log(T)+\\log^2(n)\\right)$, and Henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega\\left( \\min\\{\\log n, \\log T\\} \\right)$. We show a new lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\min\\{n,\\log T\\}\\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\\log^2 n=O(\\log T)$. Our lower bound has the following implications: \\begin{itemize} \\item We show that our lower bound extends to the {\\em online thresholds} problem, where the goal is to privately answer many \u201cquantile queries\u201d when these queries are presented one-by-one. This resolves an open question of Bun et al.

    "description": "We consider a statistical version of curriculum learning (CL) in a parametric prediction setting. The learner is required to estimate a target parameter vector, and can adaptively collect samples from either the target model, or other source models that are similar to the target model, but less noisy. We consider three types of learners, depending on the level of side-information they receive. The first two, referred to as strong/weak-oracle learners, receive high/low degrees of information about the models, and use these to learn. The third, a fully adaptive learner, estimates the target parameter vector without any prior information. In the single source case, we propose an elimination learning method, whose risk matches that of a strong-oracle learner. In the multiple source case, we advocate that the risk of the weak-oracle learner is a realistic benchmark for the risk of adaptive learners. We develop an adaptive multiple elimination-rounds CL algorithm, and characterize instance-dependent conditions for its risk to match that of the weak-oracle learner. We consider instance-dependent minimax lower bounds, and discuss the challenges associated with defining the class of instances for the bound. We derive two minimax lower bounds, and determine the conditions under which the performance weak-oracle learner is minimax optimal.",

Prior works have suggested methods of embedding watermarks in model outputs, by *noticeably* altering the output distribution. We ask: Is it possible to introduce a watermark without incurring *any detectable* change to the output distribution? To this end, we introduce a cryptographically-inspired notion of undetectable watermarks for language models.  That is, watermarks can be detected only with the knowledge of a secret key; without the secret key, it is computationally intractable to distinguish watermarked outputs from those of the original model. In particular, it is impossible for a user to observe any degradation in the quality of the text. Crucially, watermarks remain undetectable even when the user is allowed to adaptively query the model with arbitrarily chosen prompts. We construct undetectable watermarks based on the existence of one-way functions, a standard assumption in cryptography.",

In this work, we introduce a model of corrupted Glauber dynamics whereby instead of updating according to the prescribed conditional probabilities, some of the vertices and their updates are controlled by an adversary. We study the effect of such corruptions on global features of the system. Among the questions we study are: How many nodes need to be controlled in order to change the average statistics of the system in polynomial time? And how many nodes are needed to obstruct approximate convergence of the dynamics? Given a specific budget, how can the adversary choose nodes to control to maximize the overall effect? Our results can be viewed as studying the robustness of classical sampling methods and are thus related to robust inference. The proofs connect to classical theory of Glauber dynamics from statistical physics. ",

  "130_New Lower Bounds for Testing Monotonicity and Log Concavity of Distributions": {
    "title": "New Lower Bounds for Testing Monotonicity and Log Concavity of Distributions",
    "description": " We develop a new technique for proving distribution testing lower bounds for properties defined by inequalities on the individual bin probabilities (such as monotonicity and log-concavity). The basic idea is to find a base distribution $Q$ where these inequalities barely hold in many places. We then find two different ensembles of distributions that modify $Q$ in slightly different ways. We use a moment matching construction so that each ensemble has the same bin moments (in particular the expectation over the choice of distribution $p$ of $p_{i}^t$ is the same for the two ensembles for small integers $t$). We show that this makes it impossible to distinguish between the two ensembles with a small number of samples. On the other hand, we construct them so that one ensemble will tweak Q in such a way that it may violate the defining inequalities of the property in question in many places, while the second ensembles does not. Since any valid tester for this property must be able to reliably distinguish these ensembles, we obtain a lower bound of testing the property. Roughly speaking, if we can construct Q which nearly violates the defining inequalities in n places and if the desired error $\\epilon$ is small enough relative to n, we hope to obtain a lower bound of roughly $\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}$ up to log factors. In particular, we obtain a lower bound of $\\Omega( \\min(n,(1/\\epsilon)/ \\log^3(1/\\epsilon))\\allowbreak / ( \\epsilon^2 \\log^7(1/\\epsilon)))$  for monotonicity testing on $[n]$ and $\\Omega(\\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\epsilon^{-2} \\min(n,\\epsilon^{-1/2}\\log^{-3/2}(1/\\epsilon)))$ for log-concavity testing on $[n]$, the latter of which matches known upper bounds to within logarithmic factors. More generally, for monotonicity testing on $[n]^d$, we have the lower bound of $2^{-O(d)}d^{-d} \\epsilon^{-2} \\log^{-7}(1/\\epsilon) \\min(n,d \\epsilon^{-1} \\log^{-3}(1/\\epsilon))^d$.",

    "description": "This work studies embedding of arbitrary VC classes in well-behaved VC classes, focusing particularly on extremal classes. Our main result expresses an impossibility: such embeddings necessarily require a significant increase in dimension. In particular, we prove that for every $d$ there is a class with VC dimension $d$ that cannot be embedded in any extremal class of VC dimension smaller than exponential in $d$. In addition to its independent interest, this result has an important implication in learning theory, as it reveals a fundamental limitation of one of the most extensively studied approaches to tackling the long-standing sample compression conjecture. Concretely, the approach proposed by Floyd and Warmuth entails embedding any given VC class into an extremal class of a comparable dimension, and then applying an optimal sample compression scheme for extremal classes. However, our results imply that this strategy would in some cases result in a sample compression scheme at least exponentially larger than what is predicted by the sample compression conjecture. The above implications follow from a general result we prove: any extremal class with VC dimension $d$ has dual VC dimension at most $2d+1$. This bound is exponentially smaller than the classical bound $2^{d+1}-1$ of Assouad, which applies to general concept classes (and is known to be unimprovable for some classes). We in fact prove a stronger result, establishing that $2d+1$ upper bounds the dual Radon number of extremal classes. This theorem represents an abstraction of the classical Radon theorem for convex sets, extending its applicability to a wider combinatorial framework, without relying on the specifics of Euclidean convexity. The proof utilizes the topological method and is primarily based on variants of the Topological Radon Theorem.",

In order to escape strong hardness results for learning even simple concept classes in this model, we introduce a smoothed analysis framework where we require a learner to compete only with the best classifier that is robust to small random Gaussian perturbation. This subtle change allows us to give a wide array of learning results for any concept that (1) depends on a low-dimensional subspace (aka multi-index model) and (2) has a bounded Gaussian surface area.  This class includes functions of halfspaces and (low-dimensional) convex sets, cases that are only known to be learnable in non-smoothed settings with respect to highly structured distributions such as Gaussians. Perhaps surprisingly, our analysis also yields new results for traditional non-smoothed frameworks such as learning with margin.

A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets.

We propose a mathematical formalism for describing quantum learning by training on classical-quantum data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes to new data. In this framework, we prove bounds on the expected generalization error of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum information-theoretic quantities measuring how strongly the learner\u2019s hypothesis depends on the data seen during training. To achieve this, we use tools from quantum optimal transport and quantum concentration inequalities to establish non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas that underlie classical information-theoretic generalization bounds.

    "description": "In repeated interaction problems with adaptive agents, our objective often requires anticipating and optimizing over the space of possible agent responses. We show that many problems of this form can be cast as instances of online (nonlinear) control which satisfy \\textit{local controllability}, with convex losses over a bounded state space which encodes agent behavior, and we introduce a unified algorithmic framework for tractable regret minimization in such cases. When the instance dynamics are known but otherwise arbitrary, we obtain oracle-efficient $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret by reduction to online convex optimization, which can be made computationally efficient if dynamics are locally \\textit{action-linear}. In the presence of adversarial disturbances to the state, we give tight bounds in terms of either the cumulative or per-round disturbance magnitude (for \\textit{strongly} or \\textit{weakly} locally controllable dynamics, respectively). Additionally, we give sublinear regret results for the cases of unknown locally action-linear dynamics as well as for  the bandit feedback setting. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our framework to well-studied problems including performative prediction, recommendations for adaptive agents, adaptive pricing of real-valued goods, and repeated gameplay against no-regret learners, directly yielding  extensions beyond prior results in each case.",

    "description": "We study the problem of learning a binary classifier on the vertices of a graph. In particular, we consider classifiers given by \\emph{monophonic halfspaces}, partitions of the vertices that are convex in a certain abstract sense. Monophonic halfspaces, and related notions such as geodesic halfspaces, have recently attracted interest, and several connections have been drawn between their properties (e.g., their VC dimension) and the structure of the underlying graph $G$. We prove several novel results for learning monophonic halfspaces in the supervised, online, and active settings. Our main result is that a monophonic halfspace can be learned with near-optimal passive sample complexity in time polynomial in $n=|V(G)|$. This requires us to devise a polynomial-time algorithm for consistent hypothesis checking, based on several structural insights on monophonic halfspaces and on a reduction to 2-satisfiability. We prove similar results for the online and active settings. We also show that the concept class can be enumerated with delay $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$, and that empirical risk minimization can be performed in time $2^{\\omega(G)}\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ where $\\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. These results answer open questions from the literature  (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2020), and show a contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which some of the said problems are NP-hard (Seiffarth et al., 2023).",

    "description": "Can a deep neural network be approximated by a small decision tree based on simple features? This question and its variants are behind the growing demand for machine learning models that are \\emph{interpretable} by humans. In this work we study such questions by introducing \\emph{interpretable approximations}, a notion that captures the idea of approximating a target concept $c$ by a small aggregation of concepts from some base class $\\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we consider the approximation of a binary concept $c$ by decision trees based on a simple class $\\mathcal{H}$ (e.g., of bounded VC dimension), and use the tree depth as a measure of complexity. Our primary contribution is the following remarkable trichotomy. For any given pair of $\\mathcal{H}$ and $c$, exactly one of these cases holds: (i) $c$ cannot be approximated by $\\mathcal{H}$ with arbitrary accuracy; (ii) $c$ can be approximated by $\\mathcal{H}$ with arbitrary accuracy, but there exists no universal rate that bounds the complexity of the approximations as a function of the accuracy; or (iii) there exists a constant $\\kappa$ that depends only on $\\mathcal{H}$ and $c$ such that, for \\emph{any} data distribution and \\emph{any} desired accuracy level, $c$ can be approximated by $\\mathcal{H}$ with a complexity not exceeding $\\kappa$. This taxonomy stands in stark contrast to the landscape of supervised classification, which offers a complex array of distribution-free and universally learnable scenarios. We show that, in the case of interpretable approximations, even a slightly nontrivial a-priori guarantee on the complexity of approximations implies approximations with constant (distribution-free and accuracy-free) complexity. We extend our trichotomy to classes $\\mathcal{H}$ of unbounded VC dimension and give characterizations of interpretability based on the algebra generated by $\\mathcal{H}$.",

A fundamental question in this setting is: If a constant fraction of the new derivations is wrong, can investing a constant fraction, bounded away from one, of effort ensure that a constant fraction of knowledge in society is valid? Ben-Eliezer, Mikulincer, Mossel, and Sudan (ITCS 2023) introduced a concrete probabilistic model to analyze such questions and showed an affirmative answer to this question. Their study, however, focuses on the simple case where each new unit depends on just one existing unit, and units attach according to a {\\em preferential attachment rule}.  In this work, we consider much more general families of cumulative knowledge processes, where new units may attach according to varied attachment mechanisms and depend on multiple existing units. We also allow a (random) fraction of insertions of adversarial nodes.  We give a robust affirmative answer to the above question by showing that for \\textit{all} of these models, as long as many of the units follow simple heuristics for checking a bounded number of units they depend on, all errors will be eventually eliminated.

    "description": "In order to circumvent statistical and computational hardness results in sequential decision-making, recent work has considered smoothed online learning, where the distribution of data at each time is assumed to have bounded likeliehood ratio with respect to a base measure when conditioned on the history.   While previous works have demonstrated the benefits of smoothness, they have either assumed that the base measure is known to the learner or have presented computationally inefficient algorithms applying only in special cases.  This work investigates the more general setting where the base measure is \\emph{unknown} to the learner, focusing in particular on the performance of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with square loss when the data are well-specified and smooth.   We show that in this setting, ERM is able to achieve sublinear error whenever a class is learnable with iid data; in particular, ERM achieves error scaling as $\\tilde O( \\sqrt{\\mathrm{comp}(\\mathcal F) \\cdot T} )$, where $\\mathrm{comp}(\\mathcal{F})$ is the statistical complexity of learning $\\mathcal F$ with iid data.   In so doing, we prove a novel norm comparison bound for smoothed data that comprises the first sharp norm comparison for dependent data applying to arbitrary, nonlinear function classes. We complement these results with a lower bound indicating that our analysis of ERM is essentially tight, establishing a separation in the performance of ERM between smoothed and iid data.",

This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both \u201cpoint queries\u201d, where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\cX $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and \u201cedge queries\u201d where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$.  Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$.

We show that the regret of the SMART policy on any input sequence is within a multiplicative factor e/(e-1), approximately 1.58, of the smaller of: 1) the regret obtained by FTL on the sequence, and 2) the upper bound on regret guaranteed by the given worst-case policy.

    "description": "We show how to sample in parallel from a distribution $\\pi$ over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and has a smooth log-density, by parallelizing the Langevin (resp. underdamped Langevin) algorithms. We show that our algorithm outputs samples from a distribution $\\hat{\\pi}$ that is close to $\\pi$ in Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence (resp. total variation (TV) distance), while using only $\\log(d)^{O(1)}$ parallel rounds and $\\widetilde{O}(d)$ (resp. $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt d)$) gradient evaluations in total. This constitutes the first parallel sampling algorithms with TV distance guarantees. For our main application, we show how to combine the TV distance guarantees of our algorithms with prior works and obtain RNC sampling-to-counting reductions for families of discrete distribution on the hypercube $\\{\\pm 1\\}^n$  that are closed under exponential tilts and have bounded covariance. Consequently, we obtain an RNC sampler for directed Eulerian tours and asymmetric determinantal point processes, resolving open questions raised in prior works.",

    "title": "Mitigating Covariate Shift in Misspecified Regression with Applications to Reinforcement Learning",
    "description": "A pervasive phenomenon in machine learning applications is \\emph{distribution shift}, where training and deployment conditions for a machine learning model differ. As distribution shift typically results in a degradation in performance, much attention has been devoted to algorithmic interventions that mitigate these detrimental effects. This paper studies the effect of distribution shift in the presence of model misspecification, specifically focusing on $L_{\\infty}$-misspecified regression and \\emph{adversarial covariate shift}, where the regression target remains fixed while the covariate distribution changes arbitrarily. We show that empirical risk minimization, or standard least squares regression, can result in undesirable \\emph{misspecification amplification} where the error due to misspecification is amplified by the density ratio between the training and testing distributions. As our main result, we develop a new algorithm\u2014inspired by robust optimization techniques\u2014that avoids this undesirable behavior, resulting in no misspecification amplification while still obtaining optimal statistical rates. As applications, we use this regression procedure to obtain new guarantees in offline and online reinforcement learning with misspecification and establish new separations between previously studied structural conditions and notions of coverage.",

    "title": "A Unified Characterization of Private Learnability via Graph Theory",
    "description": "We provide a unified framework for characterizing pure and approximate differentially private (DP) learnability. The framework uses the language of graph theory: for a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$, we define the contradiction graph $G$ of $\\mathcal{H}$. Its vertices are realizable datasets and two datasets\u00a0$S,S\u2019$ are connected by an edge if they contradict each other (i.e., there is a point $x$ that is labeled differently in\u00a0$S$ and $S\u2019$). Our main finding is that the combinatorial structure of $G$ is deeply related to learning\u00a0$\\mathcal{H}$ under DP. Learning $\\mathcal{H}$ under pure DP is captured by the fractional clique number of $G$. Learning $\\mathcal{H}$ under approximate DP is captured by the clique number of $G$. Consequently, we identify graph-theoretic dimensions that characterize DP learnability: the \\emph{clique dimension} and \\emph{fractional clique dimension}. Along the way, we reveal properties of the contradiction graph which may be of independent interest. We also suggest several open questions and directions for future research.",

  "166_Metalearning with Very Few Samples Per Task": {
    "title": "Metalearning with Very Few Samples Per Task",
    "description": "    Metalearning and multitask learning are two frameworks for solving a group of related learning tasks more efficiently than we could hope to solve each of the individual tasks on their own.  In multitask learning, we are given a fixed set of related learning tasks and need to output one accurate model per task, whereas in metalearning we are given tasks that are drawn i.i.d. from a metadistribution and need to output some common information that can be easily specialized to new, previously unseen tasks from the metadistribution. In this work, we consider a binary classification setting where tasks are related by a shared representation, that is, every task $P$ of interest can be solved by a classifier of the form $f_{P} \\circ h$ where $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is a map from features to some representation space that is shared across tasks, and $f_{P} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is a task-specific classifier from the representation space to labels.  The main question we ask in this work is how much data do we need to metalearn a good representation? Here, the amount of data is measured in terms of both the number of tasks $t$ that we need to see and the number of samples $n$ per task. We focus on the regime where the number of samples per task is extremely small. Our main result shows that, in a distribution-free setting where the feature vectors are in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the representation is a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$, and the task-specific classifiers are halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^k$, we can metalearn a representation with error $\\varepsilon$ using just $n = k+2$ samples per task, and $d \\cdot (1/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}$ tasks.  Learning with so few samples per task is remarkable because metalearning would be impossible with $k+1$ samples per task, and because we cannot even hope to learn an accurate task-specific classifier with just $k+2$ samples per task.  To obtain this result, we develop a sample-and-task-complexity theory for distribution-free metalearning and multitask learning, which identifies what properties of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{H}$ make metalearning possible with few samples per task.  Our theory also yields a simple characterization of distribution-free multitask learning.  Finally, we give sample-efficient reductions between metalearning and multitask learning, which, when combined with our characterization of multitask learning, give a characterization of metalearning in certain parameter regimes.",

    "title": "Majority-of-Three: The Simplest Optimal Learner?",
    "description": "Developing an optimal PAC learning algorithm in the realizable setting, where empirical risk minimization (ERM) is suboptimal, was a major open problem in learning theory for decades. The problem was finally resolved by Hanneke a few years ago. Unfortunately, Hanneke\u2019s algorithm is quite complex as it returns the majority vote of many ERM classifiers that are trained on carefully selected subsets of the data. It is thus a natural goal to determine the simplest algorithm that is optimal. In this work we study the arguably simplest algorithm that could be optimal:  returning the majority vote of three ERM classifiers. We show that this algorithm achieves the optimal in-expectation bound on its error which is provably unattainable by a single ERM classifier.  Furthermore, we prove a near-optimal high-probability bound on this algorithm\u2019s error.  We conjecture that a better analysis will prove that this algorithm is in fact optimal in the high-probability regime.",

  "169_Limits of Approximating the Median Treatment Effect": {
    "title": "Limits of Approximating the Median Treatment Effect",
    "description": "Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation is a well-studied problem in causal inference. However, it does not necessarily capture the heterogeneity in the data, and several approaches have been proposed to tackle the issue, including estimating the Quantile Treatment Effects. In the finite population setting containing $n$ individuals, with treatment and control values denoted by the potential outcome vectors $\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}$, much of the prior work focused on estimating median$(\\mathbf{a}) -$ median$(\\mathbf{b})$, as it is easier to estimate than the desired estimand of median$(\\mathbf{a-b})$, called the Median Treatment Effect (MTE). In this work, we argue that MTE is not estimable and detail a novel notion of approximation that relies on the sorted order of the values in $\\mathbf{a-b}$: we approximate the median by a value whose quantiles in $\\mathbf{a-b}$ are close to $0.5$ (median). Next, we identify a quantity called \\emph{variability} that exactly captures the complexity of MTE estimation. Using this, we establish that when potential outcomes take values in the set $\\{0,1,\\ldots,k-1\\}$ the worst-case (over inputs $\\mathbf{a,b}$) optimal (over algorithms) approximation factor of the MTE is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{2k-3}{2k-1}$. Further, by drawing connections to the notions of instance-optimality studied in theoretical computer science, we show that \\emph{every} algorithm for estimating the MTE obtains an approximation error that is no better than the error of an algorithm that computes variability, on roughly a per input basis: hence, variability leads to an almost instance optimal approximation algorithm for estimating the MTE. Finally, we provide a simple linear time algorithm for computing the variability exactly. Unlike much prior works, a particular highlight of our work is that we make no assumptions about how the potential outcome vectors are generated or how they are correlated, except that the potential outcome values are $k$-ary, i.e., take one of $k$ discrete values $\\{0,1,\\ldots,k-1\\}$.",
