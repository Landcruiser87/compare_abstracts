    "title": "Towards a personalized pregnancy experience: Forecasting symptoms using graph neural networks and digital health technologies",
    "description": "Pregnancy is an intricate process involving substantial physiological changes that impact both maternal and fetal health. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to predict two common symptoms during the third trimester of pregnancy\u2014edema and fatigue\u2014using physiological measures from wearable devices and self-reported daily surveys from mobile apps. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, enhanced with a modified weighted Cross-Entropy loss to improve prediction performance. The model achieved AUC scores of 77.27% for edema and 69.70% for fatigue. Additionally, we aligned data from self-reported pregnancy symptoms with clinical examinations to carefully select participant cohorts for our experiments. We also explored how various features identified by the GNN are linked to these symptoms, gaining deeper insights into the relationship between physiological measures and pregnancy symptoms. Our findings indicate that heart rate variability plays a significant role in predicting symptoms of edema and fatigue, and features related to low-intensity activity also have a notable impact. Some of our findings closely align with previous studies on pregnancy. Our research serves as a proof of concept that symptoms can be predicted using wearable data, which may enhance the immediate well-being of expectant mothers and potentially personalize the overall pregnancy experience.",

    "description": "Generating accurate radiology reports from medical images is a clinically important but challenging task. While current vision language models show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a large language model to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model\u2019s temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.",

    "title": "Uncertainty-Aware Personalized Federated Learning for Realistic Healthcare Applications",
    "description": "Healthcare applications require accurate and uncertainty-aware machine learning models, providing confidence rather than only blackbox predictions. However, training such deep learning models with insufficient data at individual sites (e.g., hospitals) poses a challenge. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by allowing data holders to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive health data. Yet, we identify two major realistic challenges when building uncertainty estimates in FL, severe data heterogeneity and high computational overhead. This paper proposes FedEE, an uncertainty-aware and efficient personalized FL framework for realistic healthcare applications. FedEE achieves an efficient way of ensembling by incorporating lightweight early exit blocks into a single backbone model. These blocks are personalized for each client to tackle data heterogeneity. Experiments with four FL strategies and three datasets demonstrate that FedEE achieves up to a 15% improvement in uncertainty estimation from vanilla softmax entropy and is competitive with expensive baselines, showcasing in the order of 5\u00d7 improved efficiency with a 5-member ensemble.",

    "description": "The high incidence and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases underscores the importance of early screening. Machine learning models can automate clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However, the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion techniques, and task-specific design. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions. Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources, ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive, listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory health diagnosis.",

Uncertainty estimation scores can assist clinicians in evaluating the reliability of these model outputs and promoting broader adoption of automated systems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the correlation between 16 LLM uncertainty scores and 6 radiology report evaluation metrics across 4 state-of-the-art LVLMs for CXR report generation. Our findings show a strong Pearson correlation, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 on a scale from -1 to 1, for several models. We provide a detailed analysis of these uncertainty scores and evaluation metrics, offering insights in applying these methods in real clinical settings.

    "description": "Automated medical coding, a clinical high-dimensional multilabel task, requires explicit interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (DILA) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing our global understanding of the model\u2019s predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.",

    "description": "Precision medicine has the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), but it faces significant challenges due to complex biases in clinical observational data and the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact on ML models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.",

    "description": "Survival analysis is a classic problem in statistics with important applications in healthcare. Most machine learning models for survival analysis are black-box models, limiting their use in healthcare settings where interpretability is paramount. More recently, glass-box machine learning models have been introduced for survival analysis, with both strong predictive performance and interpretability. Still, several gaps remain, as no prior glass-box survival model can produce calibrated shape functions with enough flexibility to capture the complex patterns often found in real data. To fill this gap, we introduce a new glass-box machine learning model for survival analysis called DNAMite. DNAMite uses feature discretization and kernel smoothing in its embedding module, making it possible to learn shape functions with a flexible balance of smoothness and jaggedness. Further, DNAMite produces calibrated shape functions that can be directly interpreted as contributions to the cumulative incidence function. Our experiments show that DNAMite generates shape functions closer to true shape functions on synthetic data, while making predictions with comparable predictive performance and better calibration than previous glass-box and black-box models",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Barttender, an interpretable framework that uses deep learning for the direct comparison of the utility of imaging versus non-imaging tabular data for tasks like disease prediction. Barttender converts non-imaging tabular features, such as scalar data from electronic health records, into grayscale bars, facilitating an interpretable and scalable deep learning based modeling of both data modalities. Our framework allows researchers to evaluate differences in utility through performance measures, as well as local (sample-level) and global (population-level) explanations. We introduce a novel measure to define global feature importances for image-based deep learning models, which we call gIoU. Experiments on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets with chest X-rays and scalar data from electronic health records show that Barttender performs comparably to traditional methods and offers enhanced explainability using deep learning models.",

    "description": "In current neuroimaging studies aimed at analysing BOLD signals, the focus has primarily been on correlation-based features derived from time series data. Considering Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a widespread psychiatric condition, poses a complex and poorly understood pathology. Recent research has increasingly linked MDD to disruptions in brain connectivity, as observed through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Identifying the brain regions associated with neurological disorders and cognitive processes remains a central objective in neuroimaging studies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed to extract disease-relevant information from fMRI data, existing methods face significant limitations. These limitations include neglecting the frequency-domain characteristics of neuronal interactions, inadequately incorporating non-imaging biomarkers such as sex and age, and paying insufficient attention to bias and model stability, which leaves models prone to small perturbations. We introduce CoRE-BOLD, a unified framework addressing these gaps for MDD diagnosis in this study. CoRE-BOLD employs an ensemble of stacked networks that learn complementary representations from both correlation- and coherence-based functional connectivities. To further improve the model, we enforce orthonormality constraints on the graph convolutional filters to enhance intra-network diversity and apply a diversity-maximizing regularizer for inter-network diversity. Unlike previous studies, which incorporate non-imaging sensitive attributes as biomarkers but inadvertently introduce bias, CoRE-BOLD mitigates this through a prejudice remover regularizer, promoting fairness in representation learning across both underrepresented and favored groups. Our experimental evaluation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates the efficacy of CoRE-BOLD as a robust and fair framework for BOLD signal analysis in MDD detection, positioning it as a promising solution for real-world medical applications.

We introduce MAIRA-Seg, a segmentation-aware MLLM framework designed to utilize semantic segmentation masks alongside CXRs for generating radiology reports. We train expert segmentation models to obtain mask pseudolabels for radiology-specific structures in CXRs. Subsequently, building on the architectures of MAIRA, a CXR-specialised model for report generation, we integrate a trainable segmentation tokens extractor that leverages these mask pseudolabels, and employ mask-aware prompting to generate draft radiology reports. Our experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset show that MAIRA-Seg outperforms non-segmentation baselines. We also investigate set-of-marks prompting with MAIRA and find that MAIRA-Seg consistently demonstrates comparable or superior performance. The results confirm that using segmentation masks enhances the nuanced reasoning of MLLMs, potentially contributing to better clinical outcomes.",

An example of this challenge is in evaluating a summary of the patient\u2019s medical record. A resulting summary can enable the provider to get a high-level overview of the patient\u2019s health status quickly. Yet, a summary that omits important facts about the patient\u2019s record can produce a misleading picture. This can lead to negative consequences on medical decision-making. We propose MED-OMIT as a metric to explore this challenge. We focus on using provider-patient history conversations to generate a subjective (a summary of the patient\u2019s history) as a case study. We begin by discretizing facts from the dialogue and identifying which are omitted from the subjective. To determine which facts are clinically relevant, we measure the importance of each fact to a simulated differential diagnosis. We compare MED-OMIT\u2019s performance to that of clinical experts and find broad agreement We use MED-OMIT to evaluate LLM performance on subjective generation and find some LLMs (gpt-4 and llama-3.1-405b) work well with little effort, while others (e.g. Llama 2) perform worse.",

We first design a two-stage zero-shot LLM approach to analyze a patient\u2019s medical history (presented as unstructured text) and to determine their eligibility for a specific trial. We use advanced prompting strategies to guide the LLM toward faster and more targeted matches between trials and eligible patients. Additionally, a two-stage retrieval pipeline pre-filters potential trials using efficient retrieval techniques, reducing the number of trials considered for each patient.

To capture the cyclical nature of seizure risk, our model incorporated cyclical dynamics by using a special rotation matrix structure for the state transition matrix.

We evaluated the model on real-world data from one of the longest continuous iEEG recordings in people with epilepsy. The model forecast iEEG and inferred periods of heightened risk of seizures better than or comparable to baseline models, and provided novel insight into biological factors that modulate seizure risk cycles.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of TDA methods for computer-aided diagnosis from two perspectives. First, we examine the effectiveness of topological methods in data-limited settings by comparing the standalone performance of DL models, TDA approaches, and their fusion. Our results demonstrate that integrating topological features into DL models significantly improves performance when labeled data are scarce. Second, we assess the standalone performance of TDA methods in data-rich environments using the MedMNIST collection, which includes over 600K images across 12 2D and 6 3D medical imaging datasets. Our experiments reveal that while TDA methods do not outperform DL models on 2D datasets, they achieve competitive results on 3D imaging tasks.

In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants.

    "description": "Interpreting and documenting findings from cardiac imaging studies is increasingly burdensome to readers in part due to the increasing amount of advanced cardiac imaging studies which capture multi-parametric data. This is particularly true of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) studies which encode features of morphology, function, flow, parametric mapping, and myocardial viability in multiple 2D planes, but require a substantial amount of time to analyze, document, and integrate the numerous complex imaging features into a comprehensive report. Additionally, clearly communicating complex CMR findings and diagnoses to referring physicians with varying CMR knowledge and the ability to clinically correlated complex CMR findings is highly variable. Automatic interpretation and generation of the report have great potential to reduce the burden on readers and improve access through higher patient throughput. As such, there has been significant work in this area, although much of it has been focused on more simplistic chest X-ray and single view echocardiography. These data sources are represented by only a single view or have only a single source of contrast, greatly reducing the necessary complexity of the latent visual space. Furthermore, we recognize that clinical histories are important for accurate reporting. In this work, we propose to treat the CMR study as a multi-scene video and generate the corresponding report in an autoregressive manner. We further warm-start the generated report with the indications for the exam to improve the relevance of the generated report.

Using self-supervision and data augmentation to curb the model\u2019s tendency to overfit to noisy labels, our matrix imputation approach improves test set RMSE by 7.36% compared to the best performing imputation model used for benchmarking. In addition, the proposed self-supervised approach reduces the Euclidean distance of NI probabilities among age groups with similar probabilities by up to 20% without impacting model performance and uses counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to mitigate potential biases from age, sex, platform, and country income status.",

Despite the recent trend of adopting deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open) task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis, Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images. Our experiments suggest that domain guidance can significantly boost the accuracy of LLaVA-Med from 38% to 47%, with a notable gain of 28% for H&E-stained pathology images in the PathVQA-Open dataset. For longer-form question and answer pairs, our model consistently achieves significant improvements of 32.5% in ARCH-Open PubMed and 30.6% in ARCH-Open Books on H&E images.

    "description": "Modeling policies for sequential clinical decision-making based on observational data is useful for describing treatment practices, standardizing frequent patterns in treatment, and evaluating alternative policies. For each task, it is essential that the policy model is interpretable. Learning accurate models requires effectively capturing a patient\u2019s state, either through sequence representation learning or carefully crafted summaries of their medical history. While recent work has favored the former, it remains a question as to how histories should best be represented for interpretable policy modeling. Focused on model fit, we systematically compare diverse approaches to summarizing patient history for interpretable modeling of clinical policies across four sequential decision-making tasks. We illustrate differences in the policies learned using various representations by breaking down evaluations by patient subgroups, critical states, and stages of treatment, highlighting challenges specific to common use cases. We find that interpretable sequence models using learned representations perform on par with black-box models across all tasks. Interpretable models using hand-crafted representations perform substantially worse when ignoring history entirely, but are made competitive by incorporating only a few aggregated and recent elements of patient history. The added benefits of using a richer representation are pronounced for subgroups and in specific use cases. This underscores the importance of evaluating policy models in the context of their intended use.",

Further, we observe that currently, the majority of time series foundation models either are univariate in nature, or assume channel independence, meaning that they handle multivariate time series but do not model how the different variables relate. In this paper, we propose a prompt-tuning-inspired fine-tuning technique, Generalized Prompt Tuning (Gen-P-Tuning), that enables us to adapt an existing univariate time series foundation model (treated as frozen) to handle multivariate time series prediction. Our approach provides a way to combine information across channels (variables) of multivariate time series.

We develop and evaluate supervised classifiers that combine metadata features with sentiment and semantic features of texts and compare their performance against few-shot learning with instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). We conduct experiments on a dataset collected to study the communication patterns and risk factors associated with IPV among justice-involved adolescents.

By incorporating optical flow during training, HeartMAE is guided towards cardiac regions, which significantly improves its downstream performance.

Unfortunately, this exclusion can reduce predictive accuracy to the point of clinical irrelevance, especially when trials are heterogeneous. This paper shows how untrusted data can be safely incorporated into meta-analysis, improving predictions without sacrificing rigor or introducing unproven assumptions. Our approach, called conformal meta-analysis, consists of (1) learning a (potentially flawed) prior distribution from the untrusted data, (2) using the prior and trusted data to derive a simple, fully-conformal prediction interval for the observed trial effect, and (3) analytically extracting an interval for the true (unobserved) effect. In multiple experiments on healthcare datasets, our algorithms deliver tighter, sounder intervals than traditional ones. This paper conceptually realigns meta-analysis as a foundation for evidence-based medicine, embracing heterogeneity and untrusted data for more nuanced, precise predictions.",

The latent diffusion model is trained with distinct data augmentation techniques to enhance the variety of the generative data. This helps capture the dynamic nature of the cardiac images. The generative data are used in our Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to pre-train our Deep Learning (DL) model. Furthermore, because our latent diffusion model produces both images and segmentation labels, our fine-tuning process takes advantage of the diffusion-generated images and labels in addition to the GT data.

    "description": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a key technology in precision medicine, especially for cancer prognosis. However, the high dimensionality of such data may restrict classic statistical methods, thus raising the need to learn dense representations from them. Transformers models have exhibited capacities in providing representations for long sequences and thus are well suited for transcriptomics data. In this paper, we develop a pre-trained transformer-based language model through self-supervised learning using bulk RNA-seq from both non-cancer and cancer tissues, following BERT\u2019s masking method. By probing learned embeddings from the model or using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we then build downstream models for cancer-type classification and survival-time prediction. Leveraging the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate the performance of our method, BulkRNABert, on both tasks, with significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in the pan-cancer setting for classification and survival analysis. We also show the transfer-learning capabilities of the model in the survival analysis setting on unseen cohorts.",

Summarizing key information in nursing notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients\u2019 conditions. However, existing summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization. Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.",

    "description": "The task of predicting long-term patient outcomes using supervised machine learning is a challenging one, in part because of the high variance of each patient\u2019s trajectory, which can result in the model over-fitting to the training data. Temporal difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness compared to standard supervised learning methods, and that this robustness is maintained even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time series data.",

In this paper, we address these challenges by developing a pipeline for learning explainable treatment policies for RPM-enabled DHIs. We apply our approach in the real-world setting of RPM using a DHI to improve glycemic control of youth with type 1 diabetes. Our main contribution is to reveal the importance of \\emph{clinical domain knowledge} in developing state and action representations for effective, efficient, and interpretable targeting policies. We observe that policies learned from clinician-informed representations are significantly more efficacious and efficient than policies learned from black-box representations.

However, no commonly used clinical decision support tool based on existing ML models currently exists. This study presents a novel end-to-end pipeline specifically designed for pediatric obesity prediction, which supports the entire process of data extraction, inference, and communication via an API or a user interface. While focusing only on routinely recorded data in pediatric electronic health records (EHRs), our pipeline uses a diverse expert-curated list of medical concepts to predict the 1-3 years risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, by using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard in our design procedure, we specifically target facilitating low-effort integration of our pipeline with different EHR systems. In our experiments, we report the effectiveness of the predictive model as well as its alignment with the feedback from various stakeholders, including ML scientists, providers, health IT personnel, health administration representatives, and patient group representatives.",

    "description": "Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models hinder hospitals\u2019 ability in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking proficiency in both tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EhrMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EhrMamba can process sequences up to 300% times longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MPF) for EHR data, which enables EhrMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EhrMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EhrMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.",

However, a critical, underexplored aspect is whether variations in patient inquiries - rephrasing the same question - lead to inconsistent or unsafe LLM responses.

Counterfactual prediction via g-computation enables comparison of alternative outcome distributions under such treatment strategies. While deep learning can better model high-dimensional data with complex temporal dependencies, incorporating model uncertainty into predicted conditional counterfactual distributions remains challenging. We propose a principled approach to model uncertainty in deep learning implementations of g-computations using approximate Bayesian posterior predictive distributions of counterfactual outcomes via variational dropout and deep ensembles. We evaluate these methods by comparing their counterfactual predictive calibration and performance in decision-making tasks, using two simulated datasets from mechanistic models and a real-world sepsis dataset. Our findings suggest that the proposed uncertainty quantification approach improves both calibration and decision-making performance, particularly in minimizing risks of worst-case adverse clinical outcomes under alternative dynamic treatment regimes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to propose and compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods in machine learning models of g-computation in estimating conditional treatment effects under dynamic treatment regimes.",

    "title": "Reducing Poisson error can offset classification error: a technique to meet clinical performance requirements",
    "description": "Medical machine learning algorithms are typically evaluated based on their object-level accuracy vs. that of skilled clinicians, a challenging bar since trained clinicians are usually better classifiers than ML models. However, this metric does not fully capture the realities and requirements of the actual clinical task: it neglects the fact that humans, even with perfect object-level accuracy, are subject to non-trivial error from the Poisson statistics of rare events, because clinical protocols often specify a remarkably small sample size due to the exigencies of clinical work. For example, to quantitate malaria on a thin blood film a clinician examines only 2000 red blood cells (0.0004 uL), which can yield large Poisson variation in the actual number of parasites present, so that a perfect human\u2019s count can differ substantially from the true average load. In contrast, an ML system may be less accurate on an object detection level, but it may also have the option to examine much more blood (e.g. 0.1 uL, or 250x). Thus, while its parasite identification error is higher, the Poisson variability of its estimate is lower due to larger sample size. For both ML systems and humans, clinical performance depends on a combination of these two types of error. To qualify for clinical deployment, an ML system\u2019s performance must match current standard of care, typically a demanding target. To achieve this, it may be possible to offset a system\u2019s imperfect accuracy by increasing its sample size to reduce Poisson error, and thus attain the same net clinical performance as a perfectly accurate human limited by protocols with smaller sample size. In this paper, we analyse the mathematics of the relationship between Poisson error, classification error, and total error. This mathematical approach enables teams (software and hardware) optimizing ML systems to leverage a relative strength (larger sample sizes) to offset a relative weakness (classification accuracy). We illustrate the methods with two concrete examples: diagnosis and quantitation of malaria on blood films.",

Previous studies have shown that a single modality such as speech or eye-tracking (ET) data can be effective for classifying AD patients from healthy individuals. However, understanding the role of other modalities, and especially the integration of facial analysis with ET for enhancing dementia classification, remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate whether we can leverage facial patterns in AD patients by building on EMOTION-FAN\u2014a deep learning model initially developed for recognizing seven distinct human emotions, now fine-tuned for our facial analysis tasks. We also explore the efficacy of leveraging multimodal information by combining the results from the facial and ET data through a late fusion technique. Specifically, our approach uses a neural classifier to learn from raw ET data (VTNet) alongside the fine-tuned EMOTION-FAN model that learns from the facial data. Experimental results show that facial data gives superior results than ET data. Notably, we obtain higher scores when both modalities are combined, providing strong evidence that integrating multimodal data benefits performance on this task.",

In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of using a multitask approach to improve performance and fairness for depression detection. We propose a novel gender-based task-reweighting method using uncertainty grounded in how the PHQ-8 questionnaire is structured. Our results indicate that, although a multitask approach improves performance and fairness compared to a unitask approach, the results are not always consistent and we see evidence of negative transfer and a reduction in the Pareto frontier, which is concerning given the high-stake healthcare setting. Our proposed approach of gender-based reweighting with uncertainty improves performance and fairness and alleviates both challenges to a certain extent.

However, the datasets used to develop these models often do not contain the same sets of input signals. Some signals, particularly PPG, are much less prevalent than others, and this has previously been addressed with techniques such as transfer learning. Additionally, only training on one or more fixed modalities precludes cross-modal information transfer from other sources, which has proved valuable in other problem domains. To address this, we introduce wav2sleep, a unified model designed to operate on variable sets of input signals during training and inference.

Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released mpox skin lesion dataset.

Further, as there is no consistent notion of their appearance, human-annotated MLV structures contain a high inter-rater variability that most automatic segmentation methods cannot take into account. In this work, we propose a new rater-aware training scheme for the popular nnUNet model, and we explore rater-based ensembling strategies for accurate and consistent segmentation of MLVs. This enables us to boost nnU-Net\u2019s performance while obtaining explicit predictions in different annotation styles and a rater-based uncertainty estimation.

However, interpreting EEG signals is a complex task that often suffers from high variability and subjectivity among clinical experts. This study introduces the BiG-WaR architecture, a comprehensive multimodal framework designed to classify harmful brain activity using EEG signals. BiG-WaR combines several neural network models, including BiLSTM, GNN, WaveNet, and ResNet, to effectively leverage spatial and temporal dynamics inherent in EEG data. Our approach integrates curriculum learning and appropriate data preprocessing to address the challenges of EEG analysis, such as high variability and the need for robust feature extraction. Initial results demonstrate that BiG-WaR framework is a robust benchmark, enhancing reliability and interpretability\u2014critical factors for clinical adoption\u2014by integrating attention mechanisms and gradient-weighted class activation mappings to provide insights into model decisions.",

    "title": "The Self-Supervision Regime and Encoder Fit for Histopathology Image Analysis",
    "description": "This study systematically compares vision transformers (ViTs) and residual neural networks (ResNets) for slide-level histopathology analysis using self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies SimCLR and DINO, alongside ImageNet-initialized counterparts. Binary and multiclass classification were evaluated on the TCGA-CRCk and PANDA datasets using the multiple instance learning paradigm. GradCAM and attention rollout were applied for visual explainability for ResNets and ViTs, respectively. The results showed that SimCLR excelled with smaller architectures, while DINO performed better with larger ones. ResNets underperformed with DINO regardless of architecture size, whereas ViTs excelled on the PANDA dataset but required scaling to perform well on TCGA-CRCk, a more complex dataset. An emerging self-supervision regime and encoder fit suggests that DINO-ViTs and SimCLR-ResNets are well-suited pairs, though the effects of SSL methods on encoders remain unclear. ViTs demonstrated superior scalability and interpretability compared to ResNets, but further research is needed to better understand the interplay between SSL methods and encoders.",

    "title": "MIK: Modified Isolation Kernel for Biological Sequence Visualization, Classification, and Clustering",
    "description": "The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) has emerged as a popular dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data. It computes pairwise similarities between data points by default using an RBF kernel and random initialization (in low-dimensional space), which successfully captures the overall structure but may struggle to preserve the local structure efficiently. This research proposes a novel approach called the Modified Isolation Kernel (MIK) as an alternative to the Gaussian kernel, which is built upon the concept of the Isolation Kernel. MIK uses adaptive density estimation to capture local structures more accurately and integrates robustness measures. It also assigns higher similarity values to nearby points and lower values to distant points. Comparative research using the normal Gaussian kernel, the isolation kernel, and several initialization techniques, including random, PCA, and random walk initializations, are used to assess the proposed approach (MIK). Additionally, we compare the computational efficiency of all $3$ kernels with $3$ different initialization methods. Our experimental results demonstrate several advantages of the proposed kernel (MIK) and initialization method selection. It exhibits improved preservation of the local and global structure and enables better visualization of clusters and subclusters in the embedded space. These findings contribute to advancing dimensionality reduction techniques and provide researchers and practitioners with an effective tool for data exploration, visualization, and analysis in various domains.",
