    "title": "Daily Physical Activity Monitoring: Adaptive Learning from Multi-source Motion Sensor Data",
    "abstract": "In healthcare applications, there is a growing need to develop machine learning models that use data from a single source, such as that from a wrist wearable device, to monitor physical activities, assess health risks, and provide immediate health recommendations or interventions. However, the limitation of using single-source data often compromises the model\u2019s accuracy, as it fails to capture the full scope of human activities. While a more comprehensive dataset can be gathered in a lab setting using multiple sensors attached to various body parts, this approach is not practical for everyday use due to the impracticality of wearing multiple sensors. To address this challenge, we introduce a transfer learning framework that optimizes machine learning models for everyday applications by leveraging multi-source data collected in a laboratory setting. We introduce a novel metric to leverage the inherent relationship between these multiple data sources, as they are all paired to capture aspects of the same physical activity. Through numerical experiments, our framework outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy and robustness to noise, offering a promising avenue for the enhancement of daily activity monitoring.",

    "title": "SQUWA: Signal Quality Aware DNN Architecture for Enhanced Accuracy in Atrial Fibrillation Detection from Noisy PPG Signals",
    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, and mortality. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers a promising solution for continuous AF monitoring, due to its cost efficiency and integration into wearable devices. Nonetheless, PPG signals are susceptible to corruption from motion artifacts and other factors often encountered in ambulatory settings. Conventional approaches typically discard corrupted segments or attempt to reconstruct original signals, allowing for the use of standard machine learning techniques. However, this reduces dataset size and introduces biases, compromising prediction accuracy and the effectiveness of continuous monitoring. We propose a novel deep learning model, \\textbf{\\underline{S}}ignal \\textbf{\\underline{Qu}}ality \\textbf{\\underline{W}}eighted Fusion of \\textbf{\\underline{A}}ttentional Convolution and Recurrent Neural Network (SQUWA), designed to learn how to retain accurate predictions from partially corrupted PPG. Specifically, SQUWA innovatively integrates an attention mechanism that directly considers signal quality during the learning process, dynamically adjusting the weights of time series segments based on their quality. This approach enhances the influence of higher-quality segments while reducing that of lower-quality ones, effectively utilizing partially corrupted segments. This approach represents a departure from the conventional methods that exclude such segments, enabling the utilization of a broader range of data, which has great implications for less disruption when monitoring of AF risks and more accurate estimation of AF burdens. Moreover, SQUWA utilizes variable-sized convolutional kernels to capture complex PPG signal patterns across different resolutions for enhanced learning. Our extensive experiments show that SQUWA outperform existing PPG-based models, achieving the highest AUCPR of 0.89 with label noise mitigation. This also exceeds the 0.86 AUCPR of models trained with using both electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG data.",

In particular, the adaptive nature of AI models presents unique challenges to regulators as updating a model can improve its performance but also introduce safety risks. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been a forerunner in regulating and approving hundreds of AI medical devices. To better understand how AI is updated and its regulatory considerations, we systematically analyze the frequency and nature of updates in FDA-approved AI medical devices. We find that less than 2% of all devices report having been updated by being re-trained on new data. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of devices report updates in the form of new functionality and marketing claims. As an illustrative case study, we analyze pneumothorax detection models and find that while model performance can degrade by as much as 0.18 AUC when evaluated on new sites, re-training on site-specific data can mitigate this performance drop, recovering up to 0.23 AUC. However, we also observed significant degradation on the original site after re-training using data from new sites, providing insight from one example that challenges the current one-model-fits-all approach to regulatory approvals.

    "abstract": "Sleep is crucial for health, and recent advances in wearable technology and machine learning offer promising methods for monitoring sleep outside the clinical setting. However, sleep tracking using wearables is challenging, particularly for those with irregular sleep patterns or sleep disorders. In this study, we introduce a dataset collected from 100 patients from the Duke Sleep Disorders Center who wore an Empatica E4 smartwatch during an overnight sleep study with concurrent clinical-grade polysomnography (PSG) recording. This dataset encompasses diverse demographics and medical conditions. We further introduce a new methodology that addresses the limitations of existing modeling methods when applied on patients with sleep disorders. Namely, we address the inability of existing models to account for 1) temporal relationships while leveraging relatively small data, by introducing a LSTM post-processing method, and 2) group-wise characteristics that impact classification task performance (i.e., random effects), by ensembling mixed-effects boosted tree models. This approach was highly successful for sleep onset and wakefulness detection in this sleep disordered population, achieving an F1 score of 0.823 \u00b1 0.019, an AUROC of 0.926 \u00b1 0.016, and a 0.695 \u00b1 0.025 Cohen\u2019s Kappa.

To establish our benchmark, we use Homekit2020, which is a large-scale dataset collected using Fitbit devices in everyday life settings. Our results show that the majority of the SSL tasks outperform fully supervised baselines for fatigue recognition, even in limited labeled data scenarios. In particular, the domain features and multi-task learning achieve 0.7371 and 0.7323 AUROC, which are higher than the other SSL tasks and supervised learning baselines. In most of the pre-training tasks, the performance is higher when using at least one data augmentation that reflects the potentially low quality of wearable data (e.g., missing data).

    "abstract": "Limited access to health data remains a challenge for developing machine learning (ML) models. Health data is difficult to share due to privacy concerns and often does not have ground truth. Simulated data is often used for evaluating algorithms, as it can be shared freely and generated with ground truth. However, for simulated data to be used as an alternative to real data, algorithmic performance must be similar to that of real data. Existing simulation approaches are either black boxes or rely solely on expert knowledge, which may be incomplete. These methods generate data that often overstates performance, as they do not simulate many of the properties that make real data challenging. Nonstationarity, where a system\u2019s properties or parameters change over time, is pervasive in health data with changing health status of patients, standards of care, and populations. This makes ML challenging and can lead to reduced model generalizability, yet there have not been ways to systematically simulate realistic nonstationary data. This paper introduces a modular approach for learning dataset-specific models of nonstationarity in real data and augmenting simulated data with these properties to generate realistic synthetic datasets. We show that our simulation approach brings performance closer to that of real data in stress classification and glucose forecasting in people with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Modern kidney placement incorporates several intelligent recommendation systems which exhibit social discrimination due to biases inherited from training data. Although initial attempts were made in the literature to study algorithmic fairness in kidney placement, these methods replace true outcomes with surgeons\u2019 decisions due to the long delays involved in recording such outcomes reliably. However, the replacement of true outcomes with surgeons\u2019 decisions disregards expert stakeholders\u2019 biases as well as social opinions of other stakeholders who do not possess medical expertise. This paper alleviates the latter concern and designs a novel fairness feedback survey to evaluate an acceptance rate predictor (ARP) that predicts a kidney\u2019s acceptance rate in a given kidney-match pair. The survey is launched on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform, and public opinions are collected from 85 anonymous crowd participants. A novel social fairness preference learning algorithm is proposed based on minimizing social feedback regret computed using a novel logit-based fairness feedback model. The proposed model and learning algorithm are both validated using simulation experiments as well as Prolific data. Public preferences towards group fairness notions in the context of kidney placement have been estimated and discussed in detail. The specific ARP tested in the Prolific survey has been deemed fair by the participants.",

    "abstract": "Promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors remains a major public health concern, particularly due to their crucial role in preventing chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Mobile health applications present a promising avenue for low-cost, scalable health behavior change promotion. Researchers are increasingly exploring adaptive algorithms that personalize interventions to each person\u2019s unique context.  However, in empirical studies, mobile health applications often suffer from small effect sizes and low adherence rates, particularly in comparison to human coaching.  Tailoring advice to a person\u2019s unique goals, preferences, and life circumstances is a critical component of health coaching that has been underutilized in adaptive algorithms for mobile health interventions. To address this, we introduce a new Thompson sampling algorithm that can accommodate personalized reward functions (i.e., goals, preferences, and constraints), while also leveraging data sharing across individuals to more quickly be able to provide effective recommendations. We prove that our modification incurs only a constant penalty on cumulative regret while preserving the sample complexity benefits of data sharing. We present empirical results on synthetic and semi-synthetic physical activity simulators, where in the latter we conducted an online survey to solicit preference data relating to physical activity, which we use to construct realistic reward models that leverages historical data from another study. Our algorithm achieves substantial performance improvements compared to baselines that do not share data or do not optimize for individualized rewards.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses deep learning models for audio classification in a clinical setting with the constraint of small datasets reflecting the prospective collection of real-world data. We analyze CNNs, including DenseNet and ConvNeXt, alongside transformer models like ViT, and SWIN, and compare them against pretrained audio models such as AST, YAMNet and VGGish. Our method highlights the benefits of pretraining on large datasets before fine-tuning on specific clinical data. We prospectively collected two first-of-its-kind patient audio datasets from stroke patients. We investigated various preprocessing techniques, finding that RGB and grayscale spectrogram transformations affect model performance differently based on the priors they learn from pretraining. Our findings indicate CNNs can match or exceed transformer models in small dataset contexts, with DenseNet-Contrastive and AST models showing notable performance. This study highlights the significance of incremental marginal gains through model selection, pretraining, and preprocessing in sound classification; this offers valuable insights for clinical diagnostics that rely on audio classification.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic medical data generation has opened up new possibilities in the healthcare domain, offering a powerful tool for simulating clinical scenarios, enhancing diagnostic and treatment quality, gaining granular medical knowledge, and accelerating the development of unbiased algorithms. In this context, we present a novel approach called ViewXGen, designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on general domain pipelines using only radiology reports to generate frontal-view chest X-rays. Our approach takes into consideration the diverse view positions found in the dataset, enabling the generation of chest X-rays with specific views, which marks a significant advancement in the field. To achieve this, we introduce a set of specially designed tokens for each view position, tailoring the generation process to the user\u2019s preferences. Furthermore, we leverage multi-view chest X-rays as input, incorporating valuable information from different views within the same study. This integration rectifies potential errors and contributes to faithfully capturing abnormal findings in chest X-ray generation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted statistical analyses, evaluating its performance in a clinical efficacy metric on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Also, human evaluation demonstrates the remarkable capabilities of ViewXGen, particularly in producing realistic view-specific X-rays that closely resemble the original images.",

We use these pseudo-labels for weakly supervised contrastive learning (WSupCon) to detect glaucoma from a partially-labeled dataset of OCT report images. Our natural-language-inspired region-based-encoding GazeFormerMD model pseudo-labels, trained using our multi-task objective, enable downstream glaucoma detection accuracy via WSupCon exceeding 91% even with only 70% labeled training data. Furthermore, a model pre-trained with GazeFormerMD-generated pseudo-labels and used for linear evaluation on an unseen OCT-report dataset achieved comparable performance to a fully-supervised, trained-from-scratch model while using only 25% labeled data.",

    "title": "Multiple Instance Learning with Absolute Position Information",
    "abstract": "Most past work in multiple instance learning (MIL), which maps a group or bag of instances to a classification label, has focused on settings in which the order of instances does not contain information. In this paper, we define MIL with \\textit{absolute} position information: tasks in which instances of importance remain in similar positions across bags. Such problems arise, for example, in MIL with medical images in which there exists a common global alignment across images (e.g., in chest x-rays the heart is in a similar location). We also evaluate the performance of existing MIL methods on a set of new benchmark tasks and two real data tasks with varying amounts of absolute position information. We find that, despite being less computationally efficient than other approaches, transformer-based MIL methods are more accurate at classifying tasks with absolute position information. Thus, we investigate the ability of positional encodings, a mechanism typically only used in transformers, to improve the accuracy of other MIL approaches. Applied to the task of identifying pathological findings in chest x-rays, when augmented with positional encodings, standard MIL approaches perform significantly better than without (AUROC of 0.799, 95% CI: [0.791, 0.806] vs. 0.782, 95% CI: [0.774, 0.789]) and on-par with transformer-based methods (AUROC of 0.797, 95% CI: [0.790, 0.804]) while being 10 times faster. Our results suggest that one can efficiently and accurately classify MIL data with absolute position information using standard approaches by simply including positional encodings.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale wearable datasets are increasingly being used for biomedical research and to develop machine learning (ML) models for longitudinal health monitoring applications. However, it is largely unknown whether biases in these datasets lead to findings that do not generalize. Here, we present the first comparison of the data underlying multiple longitudinal, wearable-device-based datasets. We examine participant-level resting heart rate (HR) from four studies, each with thousands of wearable device users. We demonstrate that multiple regression, a community standard statistical approach, leads to conflicting conclusions about important demographic variables (age vs resting HR) and significant intra- and inter-dataset differences in HR. We then directly test the cross-dataset generalizability of a commonly used ML model trained for three existing day-level monitoring tasks: prediction of testing positive for a respiratory virus, flu symptoms, and fever symptoms. Regardless of task, most models showed relative performance loss on external datasets; most of this performance change can be attributed to concept shift between datasets. These findings suggest that research using large-scale, pre-existing wearable datasets might face bias and generalizability challenges similar to research in more established biomedical and ML disciplines. We hope that the findings from this study will encourage discussion in the wearable-ML community around standards that anticipate and account for challenges in dataset bias and model generalizability.",

These potential applications are accompanied by a surge of ethical concerns surrounding the use of Machine Learning (ML) models in healthcare, especially regarding fairness and non-discrimination. While there is an increasing number of regulatory policies to ensure the ethical and safe integration of such systems, the translation from policies to practices remains an open challenge. Algorithmic frameworks, aiming to bridge this gap, should be tailored to the application to enable the translation from fundamental human-right principles into accurate statistical analysis, capturing the inherent complexity and risks associated with the system.  In this work, we propose a set of fairness impartial checks especially adapted to ML early-warning systems in the medical context, comprising on top of standard fairness metrics, an analysis of clinical outcomes, and a screening of potential sources of bias in the pipeline. Our analysis is further fortified by the inclusion of event-based and prevalence-corrected metrics, as well as statistical tests to measure biases. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of considering subgroups beyond the conventional demographic attributes. Finally, to facilitate operationalization, we present an open-source tool FAMEWS to generate comprehensive fairness reports. These reports address the diverse needs and interests of the stakeholders involved in integrating ML into medical practice. The use of FAMEWS has the potential to reveal critical insights that might otherwise remain obscured.

We observe a similar effect on GPT-4 (0.70 to 0.40), when the few-shot examples are hallucination-free. We also conduct a qualitative evaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data.

    "abstract": "Explainability and privacy are the top concerns in machine learning (ML) for medical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Domain-Aware Symbolic Regression with Homomorphic Encryption (DASR-HE), that addresses both concerns simultaneously by: (i) producing domain-aware, intuitive and explainable models that do not require the end-user to possess ML expertise and (ii) training only on securely encrypted data without access to actual data values or model parameters. DASR-HE is based on Symbolic Regression (SR), which is a first-class ML approach that produces simple and concise equations for regression, requiring no ML expertise to interpret. In our work, we improve the performance of SR algorithms by using existing domain-specific medical equations to augment the search space of equations, decreasing the search complexity and producing equations that are similar in structure to those used in practice. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, we enable our algorithm to learn on data that is homomorphically encrypted (HE), meaning that arithmetic operations can be done in the encrypted space. This makes HE suitable for machine learning algorithms to learn models without access to the actual data values or model parameters. We evaluate DASR-HE on three medical tasks, namely predicting glomerular filtration rate, endotracheal tube (ETT) internal diameter and ETT depth and find that DASR-HE outperforms existing medical equations, other SR ML algorithms and other explainable ML algorithms.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation typically requires numerous dense annotations in the target domain to train models, which is time-consuming and labour-intensive. To alleviate this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has emerged to enhance model generalization in the target domain by harnessing labeled data from the source domain along with unlabeled data from the target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dynamic Prototype Contrastive Learning (DPCL) framework for UDA on medical image segmentation, which dynamically updates cross-domain global prototypes and excavates implicit discrepancy information in a contrastive manner. DPCL learns cross-domain global feature representations while enhancing the discriminative capability of the segmentation model. Specifically, we design a novel cross-domain prototype evolution module that generates evolved cross-domain prototypes by employing dynamic updating and evolutionary strategies. This module facilitates a gradual transition from the source to the target domain while acquiring cross-domain global guidance knowledge. Moreover, we devise a cross-domain embedding contrastive module that establishes contrastive relationships within the embedding space.  This module captures both homogeneous and heterogeneous information within the same category and among different categories, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability of the segmentation model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DPCL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

During the study period, implementation of CKD-EPI 2021 did not modify rates of quarterly nephrology referrals in those documented as Black or African American or in the overall cohort.

Most existing studies, however, use domain knowledge to design brain encoders, and so are limited to a single neuroimage modality (e.g., EEG or fMRI) and its single resolution. Furthermore, their architecture design either: (1) uses self-attention mechanism with quadratic time with respect to input size, making its scalability limited, (2) is \\emph{purely} based on message-passing graph neural networks, missing long-range dependencies and temporal resolution, and/or (3) encode brain activity in each unit of brain (e.g., voxel) separately, missing the dependencies of brain regions.

  "39_Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs Possibilities and Challenges": {
    "title": "Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs: Possibilities and Challenges",
    "abstract": "Unstructured data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contains critical information\u2014complementary to imaging\u2014that could inform radiologists\u2019 diagnoses.  But the large volume of notes often associated with patients together with time constraints renders manually identifying relevant evidence practically infeasible. In this work we propose and evaluate a zero-shot strategy for using LLMs as a mechanism to efficiently retrieve and summarize unstructured evidence in patient EHR relevant to a given query.   Our method entails tasking an LLM to infer whether a patient has, or is at risk of, a particular condition on the basis of associated notes; if so, we ask the model to summarize the supporting evidence.  Under expert evaluation, we find that this LLM-based approach provides outputs consistently preferred to a pre-LLM information retrieval baseline.  Manual evaluation is expensive, so we also propose and validate a method using an LLM to evaluate (other) LLM outputs for this task, allowing us to scale up evaluation. Our findings indicate the promise of LLMs as interfaces to EHR, but also highlight the outstanding challenge posed by \u201challucinations\u201d. In this setting, however, we show that model confidence in outputs strongly correlates with faithful summaries, offering a practical means to limit confabulations.",
