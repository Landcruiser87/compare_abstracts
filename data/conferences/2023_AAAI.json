    "title": "Causal Concept Identification in Open World Environments",
    "abstract": "The ability to continually discover novel concepts is a core task in open world learning. For classical learning tasks new samples might be identified via manual labeling. Since this is a labor intensive task, this paper proposes to utilize causal information for doing so. Image data provides us with the ability to directly observe the physical, real-world appearance of concepts. However, the information presented in images is usually of noisy and unstructured nature. In this position paper we propose to leverage causal information to both structure and causally connect visual representations. Specifically, we discuss the possibilities of using causal models as a knowledge source for identifying novel concepts in the visual domain.",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning systems are faced with a potentially large numbers of tasks to be learned while the models employed have only limited capacity available, which makes it potentially impossible to learn all required tasks within a single model. In order to detect on when a model might break we propose to use treatment effect estimation techniques to estimate the effect of training a model on a new task w.r.t. some suitable performance measure.",

    "title": "From IID to the Independent Mechanisms assumption in continual learning",
    "abstract": "Current machine learning algorithms are successful in learning clearly defined tasks from large i.i.d. data. Continual learning (CL) requires learning without iid-ness and developing algorithms capable of knowledge retention and transfer, the latter can be boosted through systematic generalization. Dropping the i.i.d. assumption requires replacing it with another hypothesis. While there are several candidates, here we advocate that the independent mechanism assumption (IM) (Scho \u0308lkopf et al. 2012) is a useful hypothesis for representing knowledge in a form, that makes it easy to adapt to new tasks in CL. Specifically, we review several types of distribution shifts that are common in CL and point out in which way a system that represents knowledge in form of causal modules may outperform monolithic counterparts in CL. Intuitively, the efficacy of IM solution emerges since: (i) causal modules learn mechanisms invariant across domains; (ii) if causal mechanisms must be up- dated, modularity can enable efficient and sparse updates.",

    "abstract": "Both of the fields of continual learning and causality investigate complementary aspects of human cognition and are fundamental components of artificial intelligence if it is to reason and generalize in complex environments. Despite the burgeoning interest in investigating the intersection of the two fields, it is currently unclear how causal models may describe continuous streams of data and vice versa, how continual learning may exploit learned causal structure.   We proposed to bridge this gap through the inaugural AAAI-23 \u201cContinual Causality\u201d bridge program, where our aim was to take the initial steps towards a unified treatment of these fields by providing a space for learning, discussions, and to build a diverse community to connect researchers. The activities ranged from traditional tutorials and software labs, invited vision talks, and contributed talks based on submitted position papers, as well as a panel and breakout discussions. Whereas materials are publicly disseminated as a foundation for the community: https://www.continualcausality.org, respectively discussed ideas, challenges, and prospects beyond the inaugural bridge are summarized in this retrospective paper.",

    "title": "Spurious Features in Continual Learning",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) is the research field addressing training settings where the data distribution is not static. One of the core problems CL addresses is learning without forgetting. To solve problems, continual learning algorithms need to learn robust and stable representations based only on a subset of the data. Those representations are necessarily biased and should be revisited when new data becomes available. This paper studies spurious features\u2019 influence on continual learning algorithms. We show that in continual learning, algorithms have to deal with local spurious features that correlate well with labels within a task only but which are not good representations for the concept to learn. One of the big challenges of continual learning algorithms is to discover causal relationships between features and labels under distribution shifts.",

    "title": "Issues for Continual Learning in the Presence of Dataset Bias",
    "abstract": "While most continual learning algorithms have focused on tackling the stability-plasticity dilemma, they have overlooked the effects of the knowledge transfer when the dataset is biased \u2014 namely, when some unintended spurious correlations, not the true causal structures, of the tasks are learned from the biased dataset. In that case, how would they affect learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In this work, we design systematic experiments with a synthetic biased dataset and try to answer the above question from our empirical findings. Namely, we first show that standard continual learning methods that are unaware of dataset bias can transfer biases from one task to another, both forward and backward. In addition, we find that naively using existing debiasing methods after each continual learning step can lead to significant forgetting of past tasks and reduced overall continual learning performance. These findings highlight the need for a causality-aware design of continual learning algorithms to prevent both bias transfers and catastrophic forgetting.",

Despite their complimentary nature, the bridge between them is still largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on causality to improve the learning and knowledge preservation capabilities of CL models. In particular, positing Causal Replay for knowledge rehearsal, we discuss how CL-based models can benefit from causal interventions towards improving their ability to replay past knowledge in order to mitigate forgetting.",

    "abstract": "A further understanding of cause and effect within observational data is critical across many domains, such as economics, health care, public policy, web mining, online advertising, and marketing campaigns. Although significant advances have been made to overcome the challenges in causal effect estimation with observational data, such as missing counterfactual outcomes and selection bias between treatment and control groups, the existing methods mainly focus on source-specific and stationary observational data. Such learning strategies assume that all observational data are already available during the training phase and from only one source. This practical concern of accessibility is ubiquitous in various academic and industrial applications. That\u2019s what it boiled down to: in the era of big data, we face new challenges in causal inference with observational data, i.e., the extensibility for incrementally available observational data, the adaptability for extra domain adaptation problem except for the imbalance between treatment and control groups, and the accessibility for an enormous amount of data. In this position paper, we formally define the problem of continual treatment effect estimation, describe its research challenges, and then present possible solutions to this problem. Moreover, we will discuss future research directions on this topic.",
