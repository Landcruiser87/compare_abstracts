    "title": "Stochastic Approximation of Smooth and Strongly Convex Functions: Beyond the $O(1/T)$ Convergence Rate",
    "abstract": "Stochastic approximation (SA) is a classical approach for stochastic convex optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\\lambda$ be the modulus of strong convexity,  $\\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk, and $\\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in expectation, an $O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha] + \\kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is attainable when $T = \\Omega(\\kappa^\\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\\lambda T])$ and approaches $O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching $O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.",

  "2_Estimating the Mixing Time of Ergodic Markov Chains": {
    "title": "Estimating the Mixing Time of Ergodic Markov Chains",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of estimating the mixing time $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ of an arbitrary ergodic finite Markov chain from a single trajectory of length $m$. The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2018+], who left the general case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is greatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and Weyl\u2019s inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the empirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility (and hence, the non-symmetry of the pair probabilities matrix), the existing perturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of states $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with better dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the connection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as straightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the pseudo-spectral gap instead, which allows us to overcome the loss of self-adjointness and to achieve a polynomial dependence on $d$ and the minimal stationary probability $\\pi_\\star$. Additionally, in the reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors) minimax rates in $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\\varepsilon$, closing a gap in Hsu et al., who treated $\\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds. Finally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for the pseudo-spectral gap, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\\sqrt m$, and improve the state of the art in even the reversible case.",

    "title": "Estimation of smooth densities in Wasserstein distance",
    "abstract": "The Wasserstein distances are a set of metrics on probability distributions supported on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with applications throughout statistics and machine learning. Often, such distances are used in the context of variational problems, in which the statistician employs in place of an unknown measure a proxy constructed on the basis of independent samples. This raises the basic question of how well measures can be approximated in Wasserstein distance. While it is known that an empirical measure comprising i.i.d.\u00a0samples is rate-optimal for general measures, no improved results were known for measures possessing smooth densities. We prove the first minimax rates for estimation of smooth densities for general Wasserstein distances, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality can be alleviated for sufficiently regular measures. We also show how to construct discretely supported measures, suitable for computational purposes, which enjoy improved rates. Our approach is based on novel bounds between the Wasserstein distances and suitable Besov norms, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of training neural network models with one hidden nonlinear activation layer and an output weighted sum layer. We analyze Gradient Descent applied to learning a bounded target function on $n$ real-valued inputs.  %by training a neural network with a single hidden layer of nonlinear gates. We give an agnostic learning guarantee for GD: starting from a randomly initialized network, it converges in mean squared loss to the minimum error (in $2$-norm) of the best approximation of the target function using a polynomial of degree at most $k$. Moreover, for any $k$, the size of the network and number of iterations needed are both bounded by $n^{O(k)}\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. The core of our analysis is the following existence theorem, which is of independent interest:  for any $\\epsilon > 0$, any bounded function that has a degree $k$ polynomial approximation with error $\\epsilon_0$ (in $2$-norm), can be approximated to within error $\\epsilon_0 + \\epsilon$ as a linear combination of $n^{O(k)}\\cdot \\mbox{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$ {\\em randomly chosen} gates from any class of gates whose corresponding activation function has nonzero coefficients in its harmonic expansion for degrees up to $k$. In particular, this applies to training networks  of unbiased sigmoids and ReLUs.  We also rigorously explain the empirical finding that gradient descent discovers lower frequency Fourier components before higher frequency components.  We complement this result with nearly matching lower bounds in the Statistical Query model. GD fits well in the SQ framework since each training step is determined by an expectation over the input distribution. We show that any SQ algorithm that achieves significant improvement over a constant function with queries of tolerance some inverse polynomial in the input dimensionality $n$ must use $n^{\\Omega(k)}$ queries even when the target functions are restricted to a set of $n^{O(k)}$ degree-$k$ polynomials, and the input distribution is uniform over the unit sphere; for this class the information-theoretic lower bound is only $\\Theta(k \\log n)$.  Our approach for both parts is based on spherical harmonics. We view gradient descent as an operator on the space of functions, and study its dynamics. An essential tool is the Funk-Hecke theorem, which explains the eigenfunctions of this operator in the case of the mean squared loss.",

We quantify the expressiveness of diffusion-based generative models. Specifically, we show that one can efficiently sample from a wide class of terminal target distributions by choosing the drift of the latent diffusion from the class of multilayer feedforward neural nets, with the accuracy of sampling measured by the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Finally, we present and analyze a scheme for unbiased simulation of generative models with latent diffusions and provide bounds on the variance of the resulting estimators.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of model-based versus model-free methods is a long-standing question in reinforcement learning (RL).  Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension.  For policy optimization, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances.  Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing baselines commonly used in practice.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.",

The technique also benefits from comfortable tightness guarantees, meaning that unsatisfactory results can be improved only by changing the setting. We use the approach for analyzing deterministic and stochastic first-order methods under different assumptions on the nature of the stochastic noise.

    "abstract": "The present work is concerned with community detection. Specifically, we consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model: its vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on the communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$, where $D^{(\\ell)}_{ij} = 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to $\\ell$. We show that when $\\ell \\sim c\\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(\\ell)}$ provide enough information to perform non-trivial community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(\\ell)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\\kappa})$ operations for a small constant $\\kappa$.  We then study the sensitivity of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(\\ell)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of $G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\\varepsilon)$ vertices for some small $\\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to still perform efficient recovery. Our proposed spectral method therefore: i) is robust to larger perturbations than prior spectral methods,  while semi-definite programming (or SDP) methods can tolerate yet larger perturbations; ii) achieves  non-trivial detection down to the KS threshold, which is conjectured to be optimal and is beyond reach of  existing SDP approaches; iii) is faster than SDP approaches.",

    "abstract": "We consider the dynamics of a linear stochastic approximation algorithm driven by Markovian noise, and derive finite-time bounds on the moments of the error, i.e., deviation of the output of the algorithm from the equilibrium point of an associated ordinary differential equation (ODE). We obtain finite-time bounds on the mean-square error in the case of constant step-size algorithms by considering the drift of an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov function can be interpreted either in terms of Stein\u2019s method to obtain bounds on steady-state performance or in terms of Lyapunov stability theory for linear ODEs. We also provide a comprehensive treatment of the moments of the square of the 2-norm of the approximation error. Our analysis yields the following results: (i) for a given step-size, we show that the lower-order moments can be made small as a function of the step-size and can be upper-bounded by the moments of a Gaussian random variable; (ii) we show that the higher-order moments beyond a threshold may be infinite in steady-state; and (iii) we characterize the number of samples needed for the finite-time bounds to be of the same order as the steady-state bounds. As a by-product of our analysis, we also solve the open problem of obtaining finite-time bounds for the performance of temporal difference learning algorithms with linear function approximation and a constant step-size, without requiring a projection step or an i.i.d. noise assumption.",

We prove an oracle inequality which demonstrates that this procedure provably mitigates the variance introduced by long-term dependencies.  % We then demonstrate that prefiltered least squares yields, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that provably estimates the parameters of partially-observed linear systems that attains rates which do not not incur a worst-case dependence on the rate at which these dependencies decay.  % The algorithm is provably consistent even for systems which satisfy the weaker \\emph{marginal stability} condition obeyed by many classical models based on Newtonian mechanics. In this context, our semi-parametric framework yields guarantees for both stochastic and worst-case noise.",

  "18_Depth Separations in Neural Networks What is Actually Being Separated": {
    "title": "Depth Separations in Neural Networks: What is Actually Being Separated?",
    "abstract": "Existing depth separation results for constant-depth networks essentially show that certain radial functions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be easily approximated with depth $3$ networks, cannot be approximated by depth $2$ networks, even up to constant accuracy, unless their size is exponential in $d$. However, the functions used to demonstrate this are rapidly oscillating, with a Lipschitz parameter scaling polynomially with the dimension $d$ (or equivalently, by scaling the function, the hardness result applies to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz functions only when the target accuracy $\\epsilon$ is at most $\\text{poly}(1/d)$). In this paper, we study whether such depth separations might still hold in the natural setting of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions, when $\\epsilon$ does not scale with $d$. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the answer is negative: In contrast to the intuition suggested by previous work, it \\emph{is} possible to approximate $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions with depth $2$, size $\\text{poly}(d)$ networks, for every constant $\\epsilon$. We complement it by showing that approximating such functions is also possible with depth $2$, size $\\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$ networks, for every constant $d$. Finally, we show that it is not possible to have polynomial dependence in both $d,1/\\epsilon$ simultaneously. Overall, our results indicate that in order to show depth separations for expressing $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz functions with constant accuracy \u2013 if at all possible \u2013 one would need fundamentally different techniques than existing ones in the literature.",

A closely related  hypothesis testing problem is to distinguish the pair $(X,Y)$ generated from this structured model from a corresponding null model where $(X,Y)$ consist of purely independent Gaussian entries. In the low sparsity $k=o(p)$ and high signal to noise ratio $k/\\sigma^2=\\Omega\\left(1\\right)$ regime, we establish an \u201cAll-or-Nothing\u201d information-theoretic phase transition at a critical sample size $n^*=2 k\\log \\left(p/k\\right) /\\log \\left(1+k/\\sigma^2\\right)$, resolving a conjecture of [GamarnikZadik17]. Specifically, we show that if $\\liminf_{p\\rightarrow \\infty} n/n^*>1$, then the maximum likelihood estimator almost perfectly recovers the hidden vector with high probability and moreover the true hypothesis can be detected with a vanishing error probability. Conversely, if $\\limsup_{p\\rightarrow \\infty} n/n^*<1$, then it becomes information-theoretically impossible even to  recover an arbitrarily small but fixed fraction of the hidden vector support, or to test hypotheses strictly better than random guess. Our proof of the impossibility result builds upon two key techniques, which could be of independent interest. First, we use a conditional second moment method to upper bound the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the structured and the null model. Second, inspired by the celebrated area theorem, we establish a lower bound to the minimum mean squared estimation error of the hidden vector in terms of the KL divergence between the two models.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of classification in the presence of unknown class-conditional label noise in which the labels observed by the learner have been corrupted with some unknown class dependent probability. In order to obtain finite sample rates, previous approaches to classification with unknown class-conditional label noise have required that the regression function is close to its extrema on sets of large measure. We shall consider this problem in the setting of non-compact metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its extrema. In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In addition, we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates without prior knowledge of either the distributional parameters or the local density. This identifies for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without label noise. ",

The algorithm is allowed to choose when to make the prediction as well as the length of the prediction window, possibly depending on the observations so far. We prove that, even without any distributional assumption on the input data stream, a large family of statistics can be estimated to non-trivial accuracy. To give one concrete example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary binary sequence $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ of length $n$.  Our goal is to accurately predict the average observation, and we are allowed to choose the window over which the prediction is made: for some $t < n$ and $m \\le n - t$, after seeing $t$ observations we predict the average of $x_{t+1}, \\ldots, x_{t+m}$. This particular problem was first studied in Drucker (2013) and referred to as the \u201cdensity prediction game\u201d. We show that the expected squared error of our prediction can be bounded by $O(\\frac{1}{\\log n})$ and prove a matching lower bound, which resolves an open question raised in Drucker (2013). This result holds for any sequence (that is not adaptive to when the prediction is made, or the predicted value), and the expectation of the error is with respect to the randomness of the prediction algorithm. Our results apply to more general statistics of a sequence of observations, and we highlight several open directions for future work.",

In a S-MAB, pulling an arm can result in both positive and negative rewards. The agent has an initial budget that evolves in time with the received rewards. The goal is finding a good \\textit{exploration-exploitation-safety} trade-off, maximizing rewards while minimizing the probability of getting ruined (i.e. hitting a negative budget). Such simple and until now neglected modification in the MAB statement changes the way to approach the problem, asking for adapted algorithms and specific analytical tools, and also make it more likely related to some important real-world applications. We are interested in the following open problems which stem from such new MAB definition: (a) how can the regret be meaningfully defined in formal terms for a S-MAB given its multiobjective optimization nature? (b) can a S-MAB be reduced to a RA-MAB or a B-MAB, transferring their theoretical guarantees? (c) what kind of method or strategy must an agent follow to optimally solve a S-MAB?",

    "abstract": "We aim to design adaptive online learning algorithms that take advantage of any special structure that might be present in the learning task at hand, with as little manual tuning by the user as possible. A fundamental obstacle that comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate a so-called step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc. A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning rates in parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user still has to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although this hyperparameter is typically not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set too small, the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing new versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically. We achieve this by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the need to specify the number of rounds in advance.",

    "title": "Batch-Size Independent Regret Bounds for the Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Problem",
    "abstract": "We consider the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, where the reward function is nonlinear. In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of arms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward that the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their expectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear, and the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz constant to encapsulate the function\u2019s nonlinearity. This may lead to loose regret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a large regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward\u2019s parameters is high.  To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness criterion, which we term \\emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in turn, leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is batch-size independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) problem, that has many applications, including influence maximization, diverse recommendations and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper bounds. We also prove matching lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic factor in the problem\u2019s parameters.",

    "title": "Mean-field theory of two-layers neural networks: dimension-free bounds and kernel limit",
    "abstract": "We consider learning two layer neural networks using stochastic gradient descent. The mean-field description of this learning dynamics approximates the evolution of the network weights by an evolution in the space of probability distributions in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ (where $D$ is the number of parameters associated to each neuron). This evolution can be defined through a partial differential equation or, equivalently, as the gradient flow in the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. Earlier work shows that (under some regularity assumptions), the mean field description is accurate as soon as the number of hidden units is much larger than the dimension $D$. In this paper we establish stronger and more general approximation guarantees. First of all, we show that the number of hidden units only needs to be larger than a quantity dependent on the regularity properties of the data, and independent of the dimensions. Next, we generalize this analysis to the case of unbounded activation functions, which was not covered by earlier bounds.  We extend our results to noisy stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that kernel ridge regression can be recovered as a special limit of  the mean field analysis. ",

Motivated by a problem of communication security, we focus on the case where the planted structure consists in the addition of a tree graph.  In the case of planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram for detection and reconstruction. In a low density region where the average degree $\\lambda$ of the original graph is below some critical value $\\lambda_c=1$, both detection and reconstruction go from  impossible to easy as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $K^*=\\ln(n)/\\ln(1/\\lambda)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In a high density region where $\\lambda>\\lambda_c$, detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes from $o(\\sqrt{n})$ to $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, reconstruction remains impossible so long as $K=o(n)$.  We then consider planted $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\\le D\\le O(1)$. For these we identify a low-density region $\\lambda<\\lambda_D$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the threshold for emergence of the $D$-core in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs $\\mathcal G(n,\\lambda/n)$ for which the following holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\\ln(\\ln(n))$ with the following properties. Detection goes from impossible to feasible as $h$ crosses $h*$. Interestingly, we show that only partial reconstruction is feasible at best for $h\\ge h*$. We conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for lines in the high-density region $\\lambda>\\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following part of this picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\\omega(\\sqrt{n})$, while at best only partial reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any size $o(n)$. These results provide a clear contrast with the corresponding picture for detection and reconstruction of {\\em low rank} planted structures, such as dense subgraphs and block communities.  In the examples we study, there is i) an absence of hard phases for both detection and reconstruction, and ii) a discrepancy between detection and reconstruction, the latter being impossible for a wide range of parameters where detection is easy. The latter property does not hold for previously studied low rank planted structures.",

This setting includes least-squares, as well as all generalized linear models such as logistic and softmax regression. For this class of losses, we provide a bias-variance decomposition and show that the assumptions commonly made in least-squares regression, such as the source and capacity conditions, can be adapted to obtain fast non-asymptotic rates of convergence by improving the bias terms, the variance terms or both.",

    "title": "Nonconvex sampling with the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm",
    "abstract": "The Langevin Markov chain algorithms are widely deployed methods to sample from distributions in challenging high-dimensional and non-convex statistics and machine learning applications. Despite this, current bounds for the Langevin algorithms are worse than those of competing algorithms in many important situations, for instance when sampling from weakly log-concave distributions, or when sampling or optimizing non-convex log-densities. We obtain improved bounds in many of these situations, showing that the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is faster than the best bounds for its competitor algorithms when the target distribution satisfies weak third- and fourth- order regularity properties associated with the input data. In many settings, our regularity conditions are weaker than the usual Euclidean operator norm regularity properties, allowing us to show faster bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual Euclidean operator norm approach,  including in statistics and machine learning applications where the data satisfy a certain incoherence condition. In particular, we show that using our regularity conditions one can obtain faster bounds for applications which include sampling problems in Bayesian logistic regression with weakly convex priors, and the nonconvex optimization problem of learning linear classifiers with zero-one loss functions. Our main technical contribution is an analysis of the Metropolis acceptance probability of MALA in terms of its \u201cenergy-conservation error,\" and a bound for this error in terms of third- and fourth- order regularity conditions. The combination of this higher-order analysis of the energy conservation error with the conductance method is key to obtaining bounds which have a sub-linear dependence on the dimension $d$ in the non-strongly logconcave setting.",

When $\\Phi(M) = Determinant(M)^{1/d}$, the problem is known as the D-optimal design problem, and when $\\Phi(M) = Trace(M)$, it is known as the A-optimal design problem. One of the most common heuristics used in practice to solve these problems is the local search heuristic, also known as the Fedorov\u2019s exchange method (Fedorov, 1972). This is due to its simplicity and its empirical performance (Cook and Nachtrheim, 1980; Miller and Nguyen, 1994; Atkinson et al., 2007).  However, despite its wide usage no theoretical bound has been proven for this algorithm. In this paper, we bridge this gap and prove approximation guarantees for the local search algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems. We show that the local search algorithms are asymptotically optimal when $\\frac{k}{d}$ is large. In addition to this, we also prove similar approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems when $\\frac{k}{d}$ is large.",

    "title": "Distribution-Dependent Analysis of Gibbs-ERM Principle",
    "abstract": "Gibbs-ERM learning is a natural idealized model of learning with stochastic optimization algorithms (such as SGLD and \u2014to some extent\u2014 SGD), while it also arises in other contexts, including PAC-Bayesian theory, and sampling mechanisms. In this work we study the excess risk suffered by a Gibbs-ERM learner that uses non-convex, regularized empirical risk with the goal to understand the interplay between the data-generating distribution and learning in large hypothesis spaces. Our main results are \\emph{distribution-dependent} upper bounds on several notions of excess risk. We show that, in all cases, the distribution-dependent excess risk is essentially controlled by the \\emph{effective dimension} $\\text{tr}\\left(\\boldsymbol{H}^{\\star} (\\boldsymbol{H}^{\\star} + \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I})^{-1}\\right)$ of the problem, where $\\boldsymbol{H}^{\\star}$ is the Hessian matrix of the risk at a local minimum. This is a well-established notion of effective dimension appearing in several previous works, including the analyses of SGD and ridge regression, but ours is the first work that brings this dimension to the analysis of learning using Gibbs densities. The distribution-dependent view we advocate here improves upon earlier results of Raginsky et al. 2017, and can yield much tighter bounds depending on the interplay between the data-generating distribution and the loss function. The first part of our analysis focuses on the \\emph{localized} excess risk in the vicinity of a fixed local minimizer. This result is then extended to bounds on the \\emph{global} excess risk, by characterizing probabilities of local minima (and their complement) under Gibbs densities, a results which might be of independent interest.",

First, an exponential improvement of the widely used merge-and-reduce trick which gives improved streaming sketches for any low discrepancy problem.

These restrictions are all essentially relaxed in this work. In particular, we analyze a general SA scheme to minimize a non-convex, smooth objective function. We consider update procedure whose drift term depends on a state-dependent Markov chain and the mean field is not necessarily of gradient type, covering approximate second-order method and allowing asymptotic bias for the one-step updates.

To naturally fit into the framework of learning theory, the players can send each other examples (as well as bits) where each example/bit costs one unit of communication.   This enables a uniform treatment of infinite classes such as half-spaces in $\\R^d$, which are ubiquitous in machine learning.  We study several fundamental questions in this model.  For example, we provide combinatorial characterizations of the classes that can be learned with efficient communication in the proper-case as well as in the improper-case. These findings imply unconditional separations in this context between various  learning tasks, e.g. realizable versus agnostic learning, proper versus improper learning, etcetera. %They also imply lower bounds that match the performance %of algorithm from previous works.

We study this as a pure exploration problem in multi-armed bandit settings and develop sample complexity bounds on the total mean number of samples required for identifying the correct partition with high probability.  This framework subsumes  well studied problems such as finding the best arm or the best few arms. We consider distributions belonging to the single parameter exponential family and primarily consider partitions  where the vector of means of arms lie either in a given  set or its complement. The sets considered  correspond to distributions where there exists  a mean above a specified threshold, where the set is a half space and where either the set or its complement  is a polytope, or more generally, a convex set.  In these settings, we characterize the lower bounds on mean number of samples for each arm  highlighting  their dependence on the problem geometry. Further, inspired by the lower bounds, we propose algorithms  that can match these bounds asymptotically with decreasing probability of error.  Applications of this framework may be diverse.

    "abstract": " We consider the problem of unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with sub-exponential noise, a strictly more general problem than the standard OCO. In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem. Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free locally private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to the law of iterated logarithms.  ",

    "title": "An Optimal High-Order Tensor Method for Convex Optimization",

The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find \u2013 in that setting \u2013 the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ).  A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as established in Nesterov (2018) and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the  Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most widely used algorithms for large scale optimization problems. While classical theoretical analysis of SGD for convex problems studies (suffix) \\emph{averages} of iterates and obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the \\emph{last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice. The best known results for last point of SGD (Shamir and Zhang, 2013) however, are suboptimal compared to information theoretic lower bounds by a $\\log T$ factor, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Harvey et. al (2018) shows that in fact, this additional $\\log T$ factor is tight for standard step size sequences of $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}}$ and $\\OTheta{\\frac{1}{t}}$ for non-strongly convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Similarly, even for subgradient descent (GD) when applied to non-smooth, convex functions, the best known step-size sequences still lead to $O(\\log T)$-suboptimal convergence rates (on the final iterate). The main contribution of this work is to design new step size sequences that enjoy information theoretically optimal bounds on the suboptimality of \\emph{last point} of SGD as well as GD. We achieve this by designing a modification scheme, that converts one sequence of step sizes to another so that the last point of SGD/GD with modified sequence has the same suboptimality guarantees as the average of SGD/GD with original sequence. We also show that our result holds with high-probability. We validate our results through simulations which demonstrate that the new step size sequence indeed improves the final iterate significantly compared to the standard step size sequences.",

Such matrices arise in various computational contexts such as learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi-dimensional unfolding. In this work we study algorithms for low-rank approximation of distance matrices.

Notably, their bound is sublinear in the matrix size, which is unachieveable for general matrices. We present an algorithm that is both simpler and more efficient. It reads only $O((n+m)k/\\epsilon)$ entries of the input matrix, and has a running time of $O(n+m) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k,1/\\epsilon)$. We complement the sample complexity of our algorithm with a matching lower bound on the number of entries that must be ready by any algorithm. We provide experimental results to validate the approximation quality and running time of our algorithm",

Our algorithm is robust to adversarial perturbations of bounded spectral norm. Our algorithm is inspired by one which uses the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming hierarchy (Ma, Shi, and Steurer STOC\u201916), and we achieve comparable robustness and overcompleteness guarantees under similar algebraic assumptions. However, our algorithm avoids semidefinite programming and may be implemented as a series of basic linear-algebraic operations. We consequently obtain a much faster running time than semidefinite programming methods: our algorithm runs in time $\\tilde O(n^2d^3) \\le \\tilde O(d^7)$, which is subquadratic in the input size $d^4$ (where we have suppressed factors related to the condition number of the input tensor).",

    "abstract": "Robust mean estimation is the problem of estimating the mean $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ of a $d$-dimensional distribution $D$ from a list of independent samples, an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \\emph{dimension-independent} rates of error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find $\\hat{\\mu}$ with $\\|\\mu - \\hat{\\mu}\\| \\leq O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$. However, error rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when $D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments. In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence that improving on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the small-set expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurer\u2019s small-set expansion hypothesis (so long as $P \\neq NP$). We also give the first direct reduction to the robust mean estimation problem, starting from a plausible but nonstandard variant of the small-set expansion problem.",

This model is extensively studied in economics since the work of Aumann (1976) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982). It is known that the agents eventually agree with high probability on any network. It is often argued that the computations needed by agents in this model are difficult, but prior to our results there was no rigorous work showing this hardness.  We show that it is  $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard for the agents to compute their actions in this model. Furthermore, we show that it is equally difficult even to approximate an agent\u2019s posterior: It is $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to distinguish between the posterior being almost entirely concentrated on one state of the world or another.

In this paper, we study sampling and convex optimization problems over manifolds of non-negative curvature proving polynomial running time in the dimension and other relevant parameters. Our algorithms assume a warm start. We first present a random walk based sampling algorithm and then combine it with simulated annealing for solving convex optimization problems.

As unlabeled data is typically cheaper to acquire than labeled data, this setup becomes advantageous as soon as one can exploit the unlabeled data in order to produce a better classifier than with labeled data alone.

Our analysis focuses on improvements in the \\emph{minimax} learning rate in terms of the number of labeled examples (with the number of unlabeled examples being allowed to depend on the number of labeled ones). We argue that for such improvements to be realistic and indisputable, certain specific conditions should be satisfied and previous analyses have failed to meet those conditions. We then demonstrate examples where these conditions can be met, in particular showing rate changes from $1/\\sqrt{\\ell}$ to $e^{-c\\ell}$ and from $1/\\sqrt{\\ell}$ to $1/\\ell$.

  "68_On the Regret Minimization of Nonconvex Online Gradient Ascent for Online PCA": {
    "title": "On the Regret Minimization of Nonconvex Online Gradient Ascent for Online PCA",
    "abstract": "In this paper we focus on the problem of Online Principal Component Analysis in the regret minimization framework. For this problem, all existing regret minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the question: \\textit{can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize regret in online adversarial settings?} In this paper we take a step forward towards answering this question. We introduce an \\textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero spectral gap in the covariance matrix,  but is then perturbed with some adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied standard \\textit{stochastic} setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial) patterns to arise in the data  and hence, might serve as a significantly better approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is initialized with a \u201cwarm-start\" vector, it provably minimizes the regret with high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a \u201cwarm-start\" vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret rates. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.",

    "abstract": "We provide excess risk guarantees for statistical learning in a setting where the population risk with respect to which we evaluate the target model depends on an unknown model that must be to be estimated from data (a \u201cnuisance model\u201d). We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary estimation algorithms: one for the target model and one for the nuisance model. We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality, the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy such that oracle rates\u2014rates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance model\u2014are achieved. We also analyze the rates achieved by specific estimation algorithms such as variance-penalized empirical risk minimization, neural network estimation and sparse high-dimensional linear model estimation. We highlight the applicability of our results in four settings of central importance in the literature: 1) heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, 2) offline policy optimization, 3) domain adaptation, and 4) learning with missing data.",

    "abstract": "We give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the oracle complexity of finding $\\epsilon$-stationary points $(\\|\\nabla F(x)\\|\\leq\\epsilon$ in stochastic convex optimization. We jointly analyze the oracle complexity in both the local stochastic oracle model and the global oracle (or, statistical learning) model. This allows us to decompose the complexity of finding near-stationary points into optimization complexity and sample complexity, and reveals some surprising differences between the complexity of stochastic optimization versus learning. Notably, we show that in the global oracle/statistical learning model, only logarithmic dependence on smoothness is required to find a near-stationary point, whereas polynomial dependence on smoothness is necessary in the local stochastic oracle model. In other words, the separation in complexity between the two models can be exponential, and the folklore understanding that smoothness is required to find stationary points is only weakly true for statistical learning. Our upper bounds are based on extensions of a recent \u201crecursive regularization\u201d technique proposed by Allen-Zhu (2018). We show how to extend the technique to achieve near-optimal rates, and in particular show how to leverage the extra information available in the global oracle model. Our algorithm for the global model can be implemented efficiently through finite sum methods, and suggests an interesting new computational-statistical tradeoff.",

    "title": "Sum-of-squares meets square loss: Fast rates for agnostic tensor completion",
    "abstract": "We study tensor completion in the agnostic setting. In the classical tensor completion problem, we receive $n$ entries of an unknown rank-$r$ tensor and wish to exactly complete the remaining entries. In agnostic tensor completion, we make \\emph{no assumption} on the rank of the unknown tensor, but attempt to predict unknown entries as well as the best rank-$r$ tensor. For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a \u201cfast\u201d (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type) rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\\times{}d\\times{}d$ tensor of rank-$r$ is $\\tilde{O}(r^{2}d^{3/2}/n)$. We also obtain an exact oracle inequality that trades off estimation and approximation error.  Our algorithm is based on the degree-six sum-of-squares relaxation of the tensor nuclear norm. The key feature of our analysis is to show that a certain characterization for the subgradient of the tensor nuclear norm can be encoded in the sum-of-squares proof system. This unlocks the standard toolbox for localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression models, with tensor completion as a special case. The new analysis of the relaxation complements Barak and Moitra (2016), who gave slow rates for agnostic tensor completion, and Potechin and Steurer (2017), who gave exact recovery guarantees for the noiseless setting. Our techniques are user-friendly, and we anticipate that they will find use elsewhere.",

    "title": "High probability generalization bounds for uniformly stable algorithms with nearly optimal rate",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a classical approach to understanding and analysis of the generalization error of learning algorithms. A notable weakness of most stability-based generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation. Generalization with high probability has been established in a landmark paper of Bousquet and Elisseeff (2001) albeit at the expense of an additional $\\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically, their bound on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable learning algorithm on $n$ samples and range in $[0,1]$ is $O(\\gamma \\sqrt{n \\log(1/\\delta)} + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ with probability  $\\geq 1-\\delta$. The $\\sqrt{n}$ overhead makes the bound vacuous in the common settings where $\\gamma \\geq 1/\\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently proved by the authors (Feldman and Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both of these results give optimal generalization bounds only when $\\gamma = O(1/n)$. We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(\\gamma \\log(n)\\log(n/\\delta) + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $\\gamma$-uniformly stable algorithm. It implies that for algorithms that are uniformly stable with $\\gamma = O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, estimation error is essentially the same as the sampling error. Our result leads to the first high-probability generalization bounds for multi-pass stochastic gradient descent and regularized ERM for stochastic convex problems with nearly optimal rate \u2014 resolving open problems in prior work. Our proof technique is new and we introduce several analysis tools that might find additional applications.",

As a corollary, our result implies that SDP achieves the optimal exact recovery threshold with the correct leading constant. We further show that this error rate of SDP is robust; that is, it remains unchanged under the so-called semirandom model where the graph is modified by a monotone adversary, as well as under the setting with heterogeneous edge probabilities.

Histograms are one of the most fundamental nonparametric families of distributions and have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. We give the first identity tester for this problem with {\\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. In more detail, let $q$ be an unknown $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram distribution in fixed dimension $d$,  and $p$ be an explicitly given $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram.

    "abstract": "In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model.   A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design).   A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.    Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive.   We address this by proposing a framework for experimental  design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution.   We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses  in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result.   In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling.   A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via the jointness of volume sampling.   Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality criterion for experimental design with unbiased estimators, which can be viewed as an extension of both A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression.

    "title": "Fast determinantal point processes via distortion-free intermediate sampling",
    "abstract": " Given a fixed $n\\times d$ matrix $\\mathbf{X}$, where $n\\gg d$, we study the complexity of sampling from a  distribution over all subsets of rows where the probability of a subset is proportional to the squared volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the rows (a.k.a.\u00a0a determinantal point process). In this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the  sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step which runs in time $O\\big(\\text{number-of-non-zeros}(\\mathbf{X})\\cdot\\log n\\big)+\\text{poly}(d)$, and (2) a sampling step which runs in $\\text{poly}(d)$ time, independent of the number of rows $n$. We achieve this by introducing a new \\textit{regularized} determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of rows from $n$ to $\\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in defining the R-DPP  is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas such as the normalization constant for this distribution. Our algorithm has applications in many diverse areas where determinantal point processes have been used, such as  machine learning, stochastic optimization, data summarization and low-rank matrix reconstruction.",

  "83_Computational Limitations in Robust Classification and WinWin Results": {
    "title": "Computational Limitations in Robust Classification and Win-Win Results",
    "abstract": "We continue the study of statistical/computational tradeoffs in learning robust classifiers, following the recent work of Bubeck, Lee, Price and Razenshteyn who showed examples of classification tasks where (a) an efficient robust classifier exists, in the small-perturbation regime; (b) a non-robust classifier can be learned efficiently; but (c) it is computationally hard to learn a robust classifier, assuming the hardness of factoring large numbers. Indeed, the question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions. First, we demonstrate classification tasks where computationally efficient robust classification is impossible, even when computationally unbounded robust classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case hard functions, requiring no cryptographic assumptions. Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn classification tasks in the large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even though an efficient classifier that is very robust (namely, tolerant to large perturbations) exists, it is computationally hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our first construction relies on the existence of one-way functions, a minimal assumption in cryptography, and the second on the hardness of the learning parity with noise problem. In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et al. (1994)). Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions or even forms of public-key encryption. This leads us to a win-win scenario: either we can quickly learn an efficient robust classifier, or we can construct new instances of popular and useful cryptographic primitives.",

In this paper, we study the problem of testing whether a given $n$ variable function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$, is a linear $k$-junta or $\\epsilon$-far from all linear $k$-juntas, where the closeness is measured with respect to the Gaussian measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Linear $k$-juntas are a common generalization of two fundamental classes from Boolean function analysis (both of which have been studied in property testing) \\textbf{1.} $k$- juntas which are functions on the Boolean cube which depend on at most k of the variables and \\textbf{2.}  intersection of $k$ halfspaces, a fundamental geometric concept class.   We show that the class of linear $k$-juntas is not testable, but adding a surface area constraint makes it testable: we give a $\\mathsf{poly}(k \\cdot s/\\epsilon)$-query non-adaptive tester for linear $k$-juntas with surface area at most $s$. We show that the polynomial dependence on $s$ is necessary. Moreover, we show that if the function is a linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$,  we give a $(s \\cdot k)^{O(k)}$-query non-adaptive algorithm to learn the function \\emph{up to a rotation of the basis}.  In particular, this implies that we can test the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with query complexity independent of $n$.",

  "86_Computationally and Statistically Efficient Truncated Regression": {

    "abstract": " We provide a computationally and statistically efficient estimator for the classical problem of truncated linear regression, where the dependent variable $y = \\vec{w}^{\\rm T} \\vec{x}+{\\varepsilon}$ and its corresponding vector of covariates $\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ are only revealed if the dependent variable falls in some subset $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$; otherwise the existence of the pair $(\\vec{x},y)$ is hidden. This problem has remained a challenge since the early works of Tobin 1958, Amemiya et al. 1973, HAusman et al 1977, Breen et al. 1996, its applications are abundant, and its history dates back even further to the work of Galton 1897, Pearson 1908, Lee 1915, and Fisher 1931. While consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the error rates are not well-understood, especially in high-dimensional settings. Under a \u201cthickness assumption\u201d about the covariance matrix of the covariates in the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the coefficient vector $\\vec{w}$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $\\ell_2$ error $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k / n})$, almost recovering the guarantees of least squares in the standard (untruncated) linear regression setting. Our estimator uses Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) on the negative log-likelihood of the truncated sample, and only needs oracle access to the set $S$, which may otherwise be arbitrary, and in particular may be non-convex. PSGD must be restricted to an appropriately defined convex cone to guarantee that the negative log-likelihood is strongly convex, which in turn is established using concentration of matrices on variables with sub-exponential tails. We perform experiments on simulated data to illustrate the accuracy of our estimator. As a corollary of our work, we show that SGD provably learns the parameters of single-layer neural networks with noisy Relu activation functions (see Nair and Hinton 2010, Bengio et al. 2013, Gulcehre et al. 2016), given linearly many, in the number of network parameters, input-output pairs in the realizable setting.",

Motivated by applications involving time-series data, there has been a growing literature on learning and generalization in settings where data is sampled from an ergodic process. This work has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is  motivated  by settings where data  is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the standard Dobrushin\u2019s condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d.\u00a0analogs, and our learnability bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.",

This result is \\emph{robust} both \\emph{algorithmically} as well as \\emph{game theoretically}. \\textbf{Algorithmic robustness:} Chaos is robust to agents using any of a general sub-family of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, the well known regret-minimizing dynamics, even when agents mix-and-match dynamics, use different or slowly decreasing step-sizes. \\textbf{Game theoretic robustness:} Chaos is robust to all affine variants of zero-sum games (strictly competitive games), network variants with arbitrary large number of agents and even to competitive settings beyond these. Our result is in stark contrast with the time-average convergence of online learning to (approximate) Nash equilibrium, a result widely reported as \u201c(weak) convergence to equilibrium\u201d.",

    "abstract": " Gaussian processes (GP) are a stochastic processes, used  as Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions.

Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose from, the overall runtime $O(t^3 A)$ is prohibitive.  In this paper, we introduce BKB (\\textit{budgeted kernelized bandit}), a new approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB)  leverage score sampling as a randomized matrix sketching and  prove that selecting inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from \\emph{variance starvation}, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most $\\widetilde{O}(d_{eff})$ points, where $d_{eff}$ is the \\emph{effective} dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both $d$ and $t$. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a $O(T A d_{eff}^2)$ runtime and $O(A d_{eff})$ space complexity.",

Despite the significant research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity bound for learning Mallows and Generalized Mallows Model. We approach the learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between the single parameter Mallows Model and the $m$ parameter Mallows model. We call our model Mallows Block Model \u2013 referring to the Block Models that are a popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the permutations goes to infinity. In addition, we calculate the exact rate of the parameter estimation error.",

Our algorithms are based on the well-studied optimistic mirror descent framework, but importantly with several novel techniques, including new optimistic predictions, a slight bias towards recently selected arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer similar to that of (Bubeck et al., 2018). Furthermore, we extend our results to linear bandit by showing a reduction to obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information problem, followed by a further reduction to convex body chasing.

All previous reductions either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade given weak forms of the $\\textsc{pc}$ conjecture. We give a reduction from $\\textsc{pc}$ that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for $\\textsc{pc}$ is $\\text{polylog}(N)$, rather than on the order $N^{1/2}$ as is widely conjectured. This is the first instance of a suboptimal hardness assumption implying optimal lower bounds for another problem in unsupervised learning.",

    "abstract": "In the general submatrix detection problem, the task is to detect the presence of a small $k \\times k$ submatrix with entries sampled from a distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ in an $n \\times n$ matrix of samples from $\\mathcal{Q}$. This formulation includes a number of well-studied problems, such as biclustering when $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is a principal minor and $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ are Bernoulli random variables. These problems all seem to exhibit a universal phenomenon: there is a statistical-computational gap depending on $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at which it can be solved in polynomial time. Our main result is to tightly characterize this computational barrier as a tradeoff between $k$ and the KL divergences between $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ through average-case reductions from the planted clique conjecture. These computational lower bounds hold given mild assumptions on $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ arising naturally from classical binary hypothesis testing. Our results recover and generalize the planted clique lower bounds for Gaussian biclustering in Ma and Wu (2015) and Brennan et al.

    "abstract": " We study a strategic version of the multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm is an individual strategic agent and we, the principal, pull one arm each round. When pulled, the arm receives some private reward $v_a$ and can choose an amount $x_a$ to pass on to the principal (keeping $v_a-x_a$ for itself). All non-pulled arms get reward $0$. Each strategic arm tries to maximize its own utility over the course of $T$ rounds. Our goal is to design an algorithm for the principal incentivizing these arms to pass on as much of their private rewards as possible. When private rewards are stochastically drawn each round ($v_a^t \\leftarrow D_a$), we show that: \\begin{itemize} \\item Algorithms that perform well in the classic adversarial multi-armed bandit setting necessarily perform poorly: For all algorithms that guarantee low regret in an adversarial setting, there exist distributions $D_1,\\ldots,D_k$ and an $o(T)$-approximate Nash equilibrium for the arms where the principal receives reward $o(T)$.  \\item There exists an algorithm for the principal that induces a game among the arms where each arm has a dominant strategy. Moreover, for every $o(T)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, the principal receives expected reward $\\mu\u2019T - o(T)$, where $\\mu\u2019$ is the second-largest of the means $\\mathbb{E}[D_{a}]$. This algorithm maintains its guarantee if the arms are non-strategic ($x_a = v_a$), and also if there is a mix of strategic and non-strategic arms. \\end{itemize}",

In many applications, multiple rounds of interaction can be costly. We restrict our attention to algorithms with a constant number of rounds $r$ and try to minimize the sample complexity, i.e. the number of comparisons. When the comparisons are noiseless, we characterize how the optimal sample complexity depends on the number of rounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor for general $r$ and up to a constant factor for $r=1$ or 2). In particular, the sample complexity is $\\Theta(n^2)$ for $r=1$, $\\Theta(n\\sqrt{k} + n^{4/3})$ for $r=2$ and $\\tilde{\\Theta}\\left(n^{2/r} k^{(r-1)/r} + n\\right)$ for $r \\geq 3$.

A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses  $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs\u00a0$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \\leq 3\\cdot OPT + \\epsilon$, where $OPT= \\min\\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3. We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g. a mixture of densities from $\\mathcal{Q}$),  then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup. We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of $2$: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.",

The problem has received a lot of attention in signal processing, learning, and theoretical computer science. The problem is formalized as factorizing a matrix $X (d \\times n)$ (whose columns are the signals) as $X = AY$, where $A$ has a prescribed number $m$ of columns (typically $m \\ll n$), and $Y$ has columns that are $k$-sparse (typically $k \\ll d$). Most of the known theoretical results involve assuming that the columns of the unknown $A$ have certain incoherence properties, and that the coefficient matrix $Y$ has random (or partly random) structure.  The goal of our work is to understand what can be said in the absence of such assumptions. Can we still find $A$ and $Y$ such that $X \\approx AY$? We show that this is possible, if we allow violating the bounds on $m$ and $k$ by appropriate factors that depend on $k$ and the desired approximation. Our results rely on an algorithm for what we call the threshold correlation problem, which turns out to be related to hypercontractive norms of matrices. We also show that our algorithmic ideas apply to a setting in which some of the columns of $X$ are outliers, thus giving similar guarantees even in this challenging setting.",

We consider identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the \\emph{Ising model} and \\emph{proper colorings}, and explore whether identity testing is easier than structure learning. For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalasis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial number of samples. Specifically, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$, we prove that if $|\\beta| d = \\omega(\\log{n})$ (where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter), then there is no identity testing algorithm  for the antiferromagnetic Ising model  that runs in polynomial time unless $RP\\!=\\!NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time hypothesis. In our proofs, we  use random graphs as gadgets; this is inspired by similar constructions in seminal works on the hardness of approximate\u00a0counting. In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results  for identity testing for proper colorings.   Our results are based on the presumed hardness of \\textsc{#BIS}, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing for colorings is hard in the same range of parameters  where structure learning is known to be hard, which in turn matches the parameter regime for  NP-hardness of the corresponding decision problem.

We consider two-layer networks, mapping $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$, with a single hidden layer and $k$ non-linear activation units $f(\\cdot)$, where $f(x) = \\max \\{x , 0\\}$ is the ReLU activation function. Such a network is specified by two weight matrices, $\\mathbf{U}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}, \\mathbf{V}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$, such that the label of an example $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is given by $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* x)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is applied coordinate-wise. Given $n$ samples $x^1,\u2026,x^n \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ as a matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$ and the label $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$ of the network on these samples, our goal is to recover the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. More generally, our labels $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X})$  may be corrupted by noise, and instead we observe $\\mathbf{U}^* f(\\mathbf{V}^* \\mathbf{X}) + \\mathbf{E}$ where $\\mathbf{E}$ is some noise matrix. Even in this case, we may still be interested in recovering good approximations to the weight matrices $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$.  In this work, we develop algorithms and hardness results under varying assumptions on the input and noise. Although the problem is NP-hard even for $k=2$, by assuming Gaussian marginals over the input $\\mathbf{X}$ we are able to develop polynomial time algorithms for the approximate recovery of $\\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\\mathbf{V}^*$. Perhaps surprisingly, in the noiseless case our algorithms recover $\\mathbf{U}^*,\\mathbf{V}^*$ \\textit{exactly}, i.e. with no error, in \\textit{strongly} polynomial time. To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to accomplish exact recovery for the ReLU activation function. For the noisy case, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that approximately recovers the weights in the presence of mean-zero noise $\\mathbf{E}$. Our algorithms generalize to a larger class of \\textit{rectified} activation functions, $f(x) = 0$ when $x\\leq 0$, and $f(x) > 0$ otherwise. Although our polynomial time results require $\\mathbf{U}^*$ to have full column rank, we also give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $k$) when $\\mathbf{U}^*$ does not have this property. Lastly, we give a  fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for more arbitrary noise matrices $\\mathbf{E}$, so long as they are independent of $\\mathbf{X}$.",

    "abstract": "We provide non-asymptotic convergence rates of the Polyak-Ruppert averaged stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to a normal random vector for a class of twice-differentiable test functions. A crucial intermediate step is proving a non-asymptotic martingale central limit theorem (CLT), i.e., establishing the rates of convergence of a multivariate martingale difference sequence to a normal random vector, which might be of independent interest. We obtain the explicit rates for the multivariate martingale CLT using a combination of Stein?s method and Lindeberg?s argument, which is then used in conjunction with a non-asymptotic analysis of averaged SGD proposed in [PJ92]. Our results have potentially interesting consequences for computing confidence intervals for parameter estimation with SGD and constructing hypothesis tests with SGD that are valid in a non-asymptotic sense",

  "122_Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions": {
    "title": "Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions",
    "abstract": " There has been significant study on the sample complexity of testing properties of distributions over large domains.  For many properties, it is known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\\ell_1$-distance uses only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ samples.  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise, even when the amount of noise is quite small.  In this case, one must distinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\\epsilon$-close to uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\\epsilon)$-far from uniform.  The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples (Valiant, 2008; Valiant and Valiant, 2017a). In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for the testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise families.   In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original distribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either explicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known \\emph{a priori}.  Focusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following mixture testing question:  Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we test if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$?  We consider this general question in various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the distributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable.  Our results  show that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the classical non-mixture case. ",

    "title": "Towards Testing Monotonicity of Distributions Over General Posets",
    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the sample complexity required for testing the monotonicity of distributions over partial orders.  A distribution $p$ over a poset is {\\em monotone} if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\preceq y$, $p(x) \\leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce a new property called \\emph{bigness} over a finite domain, where the distribution is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions on  domains of size $n$. We then build on  these lower bounds to give $\\Omega(n/\\log{n})$ lower bounds for  testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset.   We then give a number of tools for analyzing upper bounds on the sample complexity of the monotonicity testing problem. ",

    "title": "Learning to Prune: Speeding up Repeated Computations",
    "abstract": "Algorithms often must solve sequences of closely related problems. If the algorithm runs a standard procedure with worst-case runtime guarantees on each instance, it will fail to take advantage of valuable structure shared across the problem instances. When a commuter drives from work to home, for example, there are typically only a handful of routes that will ever be the shortest path. A na\u00efve algorithm that does not exploit this common structure may spend most of its time checking roads that will never be in the shortest path. More generally, we can often ignore large swaths of the search space that will likely never contain an optimal solution. We present an algorithm that learns to maximally prune the search space on repeated computations, thereby reducing runtime while provably outputting the correct solution each period with high probability. Our algorithm employs a simple explore-exploit technique resembling those used in online algorithms, though our setting is quite different. We prove that, with respect to our model of pruning search spaces, our approach is optimal up to constant factors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our model and algorithm to three classic problems: shortest-path routing, string search, and linear programming. We present experiments confirming that our simple algorithm is effective at significantly reducing the runtime of solving repeated computations.",

In the general setting of prediction with expert advice, Hazan and Koren established that in the optimization-oracle model, online learning requires exponentially more computation than statistical learning.  In this paper we show that by slightly strengthening the oracle model, the online and the statistical learning models become computationally equivalent. Our result holds for any Lipschitz and bounded (but not necessarily convex) function.  As an application we demonstrate how the offline oracle enables efficient computation of an equilibrium in non-convex games, that include GAN (generative adversarial networks) as a special case.",

    "title": "Inference under Information Constraints: Lower Bounds from Chi-Square Contraction",
    "abstract": "Multiple users getting one sample each from an unknown  distribution seek to enable a central server to conduct statistical inference. However, each player can only provide limited amount of information about its sample to the server.  We propose a unified framework to study such distributed inference problems under local information constraints.  We model the local information constraints by a set of channels $\\mathcal{W}$: each player chooses a channel from $\\mathcal{W}$, and then passes their data through this channel before transmitting the output to the server. The goal in this distributed setting is to understand the blow-up in data requirement imposed by the information constraints, compared to the centralized setting where all data samples are available to the server.  We introduce two notions of \\emph{chi-square fluctuations} which provide bounds for the  average distance and the distance to the  average of a local perturbation. When information constraints are imposed, by the standard data-processing inequality, pairwise distances contract and so do our chi-square fluctuations. We provide a precise characterization of this contraction for discrete $k$-ary distributions and use it to obtain to general lower bounds for distribution learning and testing under information constraints. Our results involve  notions of minmax and maxmin chi-square fluctuations, where  the maximum is over the choice of channels and the minimum is over perturbations. The former emerges when considering public-coin protocols for testing and is bounded in terms of Frobenius norm of a positive semidefinite matrix $H$, a function of the channel family $\\mathcal{W}$. The latter appears for private-coin protocols and is bounded by the nuclear norm of $H$ which is smaller than its Frobenius norm, establishing a separation between the sample complexity of testing using public and private coins.",
